We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.,25.04,30.619999999999997,5.579999999999998
" So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.",30.644,38.354,7.710000000000001
" And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known for most of recorded history,  and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system, or our environment or whatever,  is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought -- and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.",38.378,68.284,29.906000000000006
"Nowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.",69.121,73.081,3.960000000000008
" And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile,  and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,we've got nowhere else to go. ",73.677,88.232,14.554999999999993
" Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history,human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.",88.256,102.245,13.989000000000004
" As Stephen Hawking famously said,  we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.",102.269,115.662,13.393
" Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of sayingthat we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on.",116.799,126.903,10.104
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.,126.927,129.784,2.856999999999985
" And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.",129.808,142.155,12.347000000000008
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.,143.338,148.695,5.356999999999999
 (Laughter) And they are. ,148.719,151.454,2.7350000000000136
So let me start with the second one: typical.,152.191,158.69500000000002,6.504000000000019
" Well, is this a typical place?  Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction, and we see a wall and chemical scum --  (Laughter) and that's not typical of the universe at all.",159.427,176.686,17.259000000000015
" All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back,  and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all --all you see is a blue planet. ",176.71,186.492,9.781999999999982
" And if you go further than that,  you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe,because stars come in galaxies. ",186.516,199.01000000000002,12.494000000000028
" And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,is nowhere near any galaxies. ",199.03400000000002,205.834,6.799999999999983
" So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.",205.858,216.267,10.408999999999992
"And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.",217.237,222.618,5.381
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.,223.34900000000002,227.834,4.484999999999985
" To get to a typical place,  you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that,into intergalactic space. ",227.858,236.252,8.394000000000005
" And so, what does that look like -- ""typical?"" What does a ""typical"" place in the universe look like? Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality renderingof the view from intergalactic space. ",236.728,254.94400000000002,18.216000000000008
" Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?Well, not quite, not quite perfect. ",254.96800000000002,266.224,11.255999999999972
"You see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.",266.248,272.929,6.680999999999983
" It's so dark,  that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.",272.953,292.734,19.781000000000006
That's how big and how dark the universe is.,293.525,296.62,3.0950000000000273
" And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event, that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.",296.644,308.14,11.495999999999981
" (Laughter)  And yet, from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. ",308.164,314.181,6.016999999999996
 It's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero.,314.205,320.387,6.182000000000016
And it's very empty. ,320.411,322.269,1.858000000000004
 The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuumthat our best technology on Earth can currently create.,322.293,331.09499999999997,8.801999999999964
So that's how different a typical place is from this place.,331.503,337.883,6.3799999999999955
And that is how untypical this place is. ,337.907,340.98499999999996,3.0779999999999745
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.,341.00899999999996,344.08,3.0710000000000264
" Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to?  Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us --is creating knowledge. ",346.20099999999996,359.97299999999996,13.771999999999991
" Well, what does that mean?  Well, look out even further than we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars.",359.99699999999996,371.445,11.448000000000036
" ""Quasars"" originally meant ""quasi-stellar object,""which means ""things that look a bit like stars.""",371.469,377.513,6.043999999999983
 (Laughter) But they're not stars. ,377.537,380.08599999999996,2.548999999999978
And we know what they are. ,380.10999999999996,382.662,2.552000000000021
" Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsedtowards a supermassive black hole. ",384.438,394.299,9.86099999999999
" And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse  and some of the matter  back out in the form of tremendous jets,  which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- I think it's a trillion -- suns.",394.323,410.26,15.937000000000012
" Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlikethe physics of such a jet. ",412.78299999999996,419.268,6.485000000000014
We couldn't survive for an instant in it. ,419.292,421.57899999999995,2.2869999999999777
 Language breaks down when trying to describewhat it would be like in one of those jets.,421.60299999999995,426.947,5.344000000000051
" It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion,but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.",426.971,433.613,6.641999999999996
" (Laughter)  And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain, above all -- there's your reference -- what was happening there, in reality. ",433.637,460.808,27.170999999999992
" The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working modelof the other, the quasar. ",461.53099999999995,468.115,6.58400000000006
" Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model,  embodying the same mathematical relationshipsand the same causal structure. ",468.13899999999995,479.164,11.025000000000034
"Now, that is knowledge. ",479.188,481.226,2.038000000000011
" And if that weren't amazing enough,  the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the otheris increasing with time. ",481.916,489.941,8.024999999999977
That is the growth of knowledge. ,489.965,492.438,2.473000000000013
" So, the laws of physics have this special property, that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be can, nevertheless, embody the same mathematical and causal structureand to do it more and more so over time. ",492.462,509.268,16.805999999999983
So we are a chemical scum that is different.,509.926,513.201,3.275000000000034
This chemical scum has universality. ,513.225,516.714,3.4890000000000327
" Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision,the structure of everything. ",516.738,522.5600000000001,5.822000000000003
" This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essenceof the whole of the rest of physical reality.",522.5840000000001,535.149,12.56499999999994
" And so, far from being insignificant,  the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world.",535.173,547.34,12.16700000000003
" Now, how does the solar system -- our environment, in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe? Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis -- one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics,there's no special dispensation, no miracles involved.",548.289,574.775,26.48599999999999
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.,574.799,578.944,4.144999999999982
" One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.",578.968,585.588,6.6200000000000045
" Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer,and there's no known way of making a computer without matter.",585.612,592.572,6.960000000000036
" We also need energy to make the computer, and most important, to make the media, in effect, onto which we recordthe knowledge that we discover. ",592.596,601.834,9.237999999999943
" And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations,is evidence. ",601.858,613.332,11.474000000000046
"Now, our environment is inundated with evidence.",614.103,617.1809999999999,3.0779999999999745
" We happened to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's law of gravity,about 300 years ago. ",617.2049999999999,624.636,7.43100000000004
" But the evidence that we used to do that  was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that, and we'll continue to fall for billions of years afterwards.",624.66,636.781,12.120999999999981
And the same is true for all the other sciences.,637.425,639.929,2.504000000000019
" As far as we know,  evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciencesis here just for the taking, on our planet.",639.953,649.132,9.178999999999974
 Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy. ,649.156,654.476,5.32000000000005
" Out in intergalactic space,  those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply -- as I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there.",654.5,666.211,11.711000000000013
" Or is it? Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.",667.386,672.971,5.585000000000036
" (Laughter)  Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space,the same size as our home, the solar system.",672.995,682.583,9.587999999999965
" Now, that cube is very empty by human standards,but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.",682.607,690.834,8.226999999999975
" And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station, on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.",690.858,702.268,11.410000000000082
" Now, it's way beyond present technology  to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic spaceand form it into other elements and so on. ",702.6569999999999,712.0939999999999,9.437000000000012
" But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.",712.73,726.913,14.182999999999993
" If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply,because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.",726.937,733.807,6.8700000000000045
" And evidence?  Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.",733.831,747.0,13.168999999999983
" And with a more powerful telescope,  you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies,you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics.",747.54,755.981,8.441000000000031
" And locally there, you could build particle acceleratorsand learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.",756.005,762.001,5.995999999999981
 Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- (Laughter)  because it would take several hundred million yearsto get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.,762.025,774.106,12.081000000000017
" But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much -- (Laughter)  and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years. ",774.13,785.175,11.044999999999959
" (Laughter)  So, in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisitesfor the open-ended creation of knowledge. ",785.199,796.6,11.401000000000067
" Any such cube anywhere in the universe  could become the same kind of hub that we are,if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.",797.215,809.7669999999999,12.551999999999907
"So, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.",810.616,814.09,3.4740000000000464
" If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations,  then so is almost every other environment, so is the Earth. ",814.1139999999999,822.597,8.483000000000061
So is a polluted Earth. ,822.621,824.951,2.330000000000041
" And the limiting factor, there and here,  is not resources -- because they're plentiful --but knowledge, which is scarce. ",825.379,834.098,8.718999999999937
" Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and, I think, ought to --make us feel very special. ",834.5369999999999,842.87,8.333000000000084
" But it should also make us feel vulnerable, because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe,we won't survive them. ",842.894,853.834,10.93999999999994
" All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away, and we'll all be dead!  Martin Rees has recently written a book  about our vulnerability to all sorts of things, from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong,and most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.",853.858,873.293,19.43500000000006
 And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chanceof surviving this century. ,873.317,878.11,4.793000000000006
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.,878.134,881.269,3.134999999999991
" Now, I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in,  but I do agree with him about this: we can survive and we can fail to survive. ",881.293,893.7819999999999,12.488999999999919
" But it depends, not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.",894.423,900.834,6.4109999999999445
The danger is not at all unprecedented. ,900.858,903.66,2.802000000000021
Species go extinct all the time. ,903.684,906.905,3.2210000000000036
Civilizations end. ,906.929,909.184,2.2549999999999955
 The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history. ,909.208,915.156,5.947999999999979
" And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others, namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics, our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge --to be a hub of existence. ",915.18,940.388,25.208000000000084
" So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution,but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.",940.7769999999999,950.394,9.617000000000075
And the controversy is global warming. ,950.418,952.834,2.41599999999994
"Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.",952.858,955.8629999999999,3.0049999999999955
"In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman.",955.887,959.674,3.7870000000000346
 And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.,959.698,967.001,7.302999999999997
" And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster, because, if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol,  with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is,then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.",967.025,990.915,23.889999999999986
" And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,merely to postpone it by a little. ",991.299,998.713,7.413999999999987
" So it's already too late to avoid it,  and it probably has been too late to avoid itever since before anyone realized the danger.",998.737,1007.275,8.538000000000011
" It was probably already too late in the 1970s, when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age,in which billions would die. ",1007.299,1019.3639999999999,12.06499999999994
" Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me, and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.",1020.17,1025.94,5.7700000000000955
It is that we can't always know. ,1025.964,1029.27,3.30600000000004
" When we know of an impending disaster  and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself,then there's not going to be much argument, really.",1029.294,1039.564,10.269999999999982
 But no precautions and no precautionary principlecan avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.,1039.5880000000002,1048.269,8.680999999999813
" Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance. ",1048.9270000000001,1055.981,7.05399999999986
" And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure,but that's only if we know what to prevent.",1056.5700000000002,1062.9060000000002,6.336000000000013
" If you've been punched on the nose,  then the science of medicine does not consist ofteaching you how to avoid punches. ",1062.93,1069.488,6.557999999999993
" (Laughter)  If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only,then it would achieve very little of either.",1069.5120000000002,1078.605,9.092999999999847
 The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.,1078.6290000000001,1085.4750000000001,6.846000000000004
" It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature and with plans to live at the higher temperature --and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply.",1085.856,1096.366,10.509999999999991

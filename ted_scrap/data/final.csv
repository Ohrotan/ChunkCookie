We are at a remarkable moment in time. ,25.131,29.156,4.024999999999999,2093
 We face over the next two decades  two fundamental transformations  that will determine whether the next 100 years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. ,29.156,41.385,12.229000000000001,2093
Let me illustrate with an example. ,41.385,44.107,2.7220000000000013,2093
 I first visited Beijing 25 years ago to teach at the People's University of China. ,44.107,50.407,6.299999999999998,2093
" China was getting serious about market economics  and about university education, so they decided to call in the foreign experts. ",50.407,60.173,9.766000000000004,2093
" Like most other people, I moved around Beijing by bicycle. ",60.173,64.59400000000001,4.421000000000007,2093
" Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle, it was a safe and easy way to get around. ",64.59400000000001,70.095,5.5009999999999915,2093
 Cycling in Beijing now is a completely different prospect. ,70.095,74.28,4.185000000000001,2093
The roads are jammed by cars and trucks. ,74.28,77.423,3.1430000000000007,2093
 The air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel. ,77.423,82.834,5.411000000000001,2093
" When I was there last in the spring,  there was an advisory for people of my age —  over 65 — to stay indoors and not move much. ",82.834,93.04899999999999,10.215000000000003,2093
 How did this come about?  It came from the way in which Beijing has grown as a city. ,93.04899999999999,99.66799999999999,6.619,2093
" It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled, from 10 million to 20 million. ",99.66799999999999,104.304,4.635999999999996,2093
" It's become a sprawling urban area  dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy, particularly coal. ",104.304,112.179,7.875,2093
" China burns half the world's coal each year,  and that's why, it is a key reason why,  it is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. ",112.179,125.307,13.128,2093
" At the same time, we have to recognize that in that period China has grown remarkably. ",125.307,130.605,5.2979999999999885,2093
It has become the world's second largest economy. ,130.605,133.046,2.4410000000000025,2093
 Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. ,133.046,136.68,3.634000000000015,2093
That's really important. ,136.68,138.761,2.080999999999989,2093
" But at the same time, the people of China  are asking the question:  What's the value of this growth  if our cities are unlivable?  They've analyzed, diagnosed  that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development. ",138.761,154.161,15.400000000000004,2093
China's planning to scale back coal. ,154.161,156.49,2.329000000000008,2093
It's looking to build its cities in different ways. ,156.49,162.351,5.860999999999991,2093
" Now, the growth of China  is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change, in the structure of the world economy. ",162.351,170.675,8.324000000000012,2093
" Just 25 years ago, the developing countries,  the poorer countries of the world,  were, notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people, they accounted for only about a third of the world's output. ",170.675,183.028,12.35299999999998,2093
" Now it's more than half;  25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds  from the countries that we saw 25 years ago as developing. ",183.028,192.12400000000002,9.096000000000004,2093
That's a remarkable change. ,192.12400000000002,193.722,1.5980000000000132,2093
" It means that most countries around the world,  rich or poor, are going to be facing  the two fundamental transformations that I want to talk about and highlight. ",193.722,203.34799999999998,9.626000000000003,2093
" Now, the first of these transformations  is the basic structural change  of the economies and societies  that I've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing. ",203.34799999999998,215.248,11.900000000000004,2093
Fifty percent now in urban areas. ,215.248,218.207,2.9589999999999748,2093
That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050. ,218.207,221.81799999999998,3.6110000000000175,2093
" Over the next two decades, we'll see  the demand for energy rise by 40 percent,  and the growth in the economy and in the population  is putting increasing pressure on our land, on our water and on our forests. ",221.81799999999998,237.81400000000002,15.995999999999981,2093
This is profound structural change. ,237.81400000000002,241.099,3.285000000000025,2093
" If we manage it in a negligent  or a shortsighted way,  we will create waste, pollution, congestion, destruction of land and forests. ",241.099,252.709,11.609999999999983,2093
" If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated  with my numbers — cities, energy, land —  if we manage all that badly,  then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods  of the people around the world would be poor and damaged. ",252.709,267.524,14.814999999999998,2093
" And more than that,  the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise, with immense risks to our climate. ",267.524,276.535,9.010999999999967,2093
 Concentrations of greenhouse gases  in the atmosphere are already higher than they've been for millions of years. ,276.535,285.134,8.598999999999991,2093
" If we go on increasing those concentrations,  we risk temperatures over the next century or so  that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years. ",285.134,296.968,11.834000000000005,2093
" We've been around as Homo sapiens —  that's a rather generous definition, sapiens — for perhaps a quarter of a million years, a quarter of a million.",296.968,305.068,8.100000000000023,2093
 We risk temperatures we haven't seen for tens of millions of years over a century. ,305.068,311.0379999999999,5.96999999999997,2093
 That would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet. ,311.0379999999999,317.337,6.299000000000034,2093
" It would lead to changing deserts,  changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,  changing sea levels,  hundreds of millions of people,  perhaps billions of people who would have to move,  and if we've learned anything from history, that means severe and extended conflict. ",317.337,336.523,19.185999999999982,2093
And we couldn't just turn it off. ,336.523,338.4009999999999,1.8779999999999857,2093
You can't make a peace treaty with the planet. ,338.4009999999999,340.831,2.430000000000007,2093
You can't negotiate with the laws of physics. ,340.831,343.05800000000005,2.2270000000000323,2093
You're in there. You're stuck. ,343.05800000000005,344.773,1.714999999999975,2093
" Those are the stakes we're playing for,  and that's why we have to make this second transformation, the climate transformation, and move to a low-carbon economy. ",344.773,353.194,8.420999999999992,2093
" Now, the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway. ",353.194,356.653,3.459000000000003,2093
" We have to decide whether to do it well or badly, the economic, or structural, transformation. ",356.653,361.32,4.66700000000003,2093
" But the second of the transformations, the climate transformations, we have to decide to do. ",361.32,367.324,6.003999999999963,2093
 Those two transformations face us in the next two decades. ,367.324,371.716,4.392000000000053,2093
 The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do. ,371.716,377.644,5.927999999999997,2093
" Now, the more I've thought about this,  the two transformations coming together,  the more I've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity. ",377.644,385.766,8.121999999999957,2093
 It's an opportunity which we can use or it's an opportunity which we can lose. ,385.766,391.39,5.624000000000024,2093
" And let me explain through those three key areas that I've identified: cities, energy and land. ",391.39,396.82300000000004,5.432999999999993,2093
And let me start with cities. ,396.82300000000004,398.877,2.0539999999999736,2093
" I've already described the problems of Beijing: pollution, congestion, waste and so on. ",398.877,405.756,6.879000000000019,2093
 Surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world. ,405.756,410.705,4.949000000000012,2093
" Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities, you have to think ahead. ",410.705,416.694,5.988999999999976,2093
" The cities that are going to be built —  and there are many, and many big ones —  we have to think of how to design them  in a compact way so we can save travel time  and we can save energy.",416.694,426.522,9.828000000000033,2093
" The cities that already are  there, well established, we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better  within those cities, and make it easier, encourage more people, to live closer to the center. ",426.522,442.269,15.747000000000016,2093
 We've got examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that. ,442.269,446.971,4.701999999999998,2093
" The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia  is a very important case of how to move around  safely and quickly in a non-polluting way  in a city: very frequent buses,  strongly protected routes, the same service, really,  as an underground railway system,  but much, much cheaper  and can be done much more quickly,  a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that's developing. ",446.971,472.564,25.59299999999996,2093
"Now, some things in cities do take time. ",472.564,474.465,1.9010000000000105,2093
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly. ,474.465,477.51800000000003,3.0529999999999973,2093
"Take my hometown, London. ",477.51800000000003,479.622,2.103999999999985,2093
" In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people and badly damaged the lives of many, many more. ",479.622,487.60400000000004,7.982000000000028,2093
And it happened all the time. ,487.60400000000004,488.954,1.3499999999999657,2093
For those of you live outside London in the U.K. ,488.954,491.456,2.502000000000009,2093
will remember it used to be called The Smoke. ,491.456,493.649,2.1930000000000405,2093
That's the way London was. ,493.649,495.325,1.6759999999999875,2093
" By regulating coal, within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly reduced. ",495.325,500.495,5.170000000000017,2093
I remember the smogs well. ,500.495,502.05,1.55499999999995,2093
" When the visibility dropped to [less] than  a few meters, they stopped the buses and I had to walk. ",502.05,508.622,6.572000000000003,2093
This was the 1950s. ,508.622,510.68,2.0579999999999927,2093
I had to walk home three miles from school. ,510.68,514.578,3.898000000000025,2093
"Again, breathing was a hazardous activity. ",514.578,518.1469999999999,3.5690000000000737,2093
But it was changed. It was changed by a decision. ,518.1469999999999,520.825,2.6779999999999973,2093
" Good decisions can bring good results, striking results, quickly. ",520.825,526.359,5.533999999999992,2093
" We've seen more: In London, we've introduced the congestion charge, actually quite quickly and effectively,  and we've seen great improvements in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system. ",526.359,537.64,11.280999999999947,2093
" You can see that the two transformations I've described, the structural and the climate, come very much together. ",537.64,545.3480000000001,7.70799999999997,2093
"But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities, ",545.3480000000001,548.281,2.9329999999999927,2093
" and we have to invest wisely, and if we do,  we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,  more attractive cities, more productive cities,  and stronger community in those cities —  public transport, recycling, reusing, all sorts of things that bring communities together. ",548.281,567.071,18.790000000000077,2093
" We can do that, but we have to think, we have to invest, we have to plan. ",567.071,571.2080000000001,4.136999999999944,2093
Let me turn to energy. ,571.2080000000001,573.379,2.171000000000049,2093
" Now, energy over the last 25 years has increased by about 50 percent. ",573.379,578.837,5.45799999999997,2093
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels. ,578.837,581.4540000000001,2.616999999999962,2093
" Over the next 20 years, perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so. ",581.4540000000001,586.888,5.434000000000084,2093
" We have to invest strongly in energy,  we have to use it much more efficiently, and we have to make it clean. ",586.888,594.384,7.495999999999981,2093
We can see how to do that. ,594.384,595.7139999999998,1.3299999999999272,2093
Take the example of California. ,595.7139999999998,597.6179999999998,1.9039999999999964,2093
 It would be in the top 10 countries in the world if it was independent. ,597.6179999999998,602.771,5.15300000000002,2093
 I don't want to start any —  (Laughter) California's a big place. ,602.771,610.679,7.908000000000015,2093
" (Laughter)  In the next five or six years,  they will likely move from  around 20 percent in renewables —  wind, solar and so on —  to over 33 percent,  and that would bring California back  to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020  to where they were in 1990,  a period when the economy in California would more or less have doubled. ",610.679,634.756,24.077,2093
That's a striking achievement. ,634.756,636.206,1.4500000000000457,2093
It shows what can be done. ,636.206,637.689,1.4829999999999472,2093
 Not just California — the  incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology  to light up the homes  of 400 million people who don't have electricity in India. ,637.689,649.169,11.480000000000016,2093
They've set themselves a target of five years. ,649.169,651.649,2.480000000000018,2093
I think they've got a good chance of doing that. ,651.649,654.8779999999998,3.2289999999999286,2093
" We'll see, but what you're seeing now is people moving much more quickly. ",654.8779999999998,659.8480000000001,4.970000000000027,2093
" Four hundred million, more than the population of the United States. ",659.8480000000001,663.7080000000001,3.8600000000000136,2093
 Those are the kinds of ambitions now  people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of change. ,663.7080000000001,671.987,8.278999999999996,2093
" Again, you can see  good decisions can bring quick results,  and those two transformations, the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon, are intimately intertwined. ",671.987,683.305,11.317999999999984,2093
" Do the first one well, the structural,  the second one on the climate becomes much easier. ",683.305,690.29,6.985000000000013,2093
" Look at land, land and particularly forests. ",690.29,694.6669999999999,4.377000000000066,2093
 Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species. ,694.6669999999999,700.2560000000001,5.588999999999942,2093
" They hold water in the soil  and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, fundamental to the tackling of climate change. ",700.2560000000001,708.591,8.335000000000036,2093
But we're losing our forests. ,708.591,710.823,2.231999999999971,2093
" In the last decade, we've lost a forest area  the size of Portugal, and much more has been degraded. ",710.823,718.2560000000001,7.432999999999992,2093
 But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that. ,718.2560000000001,722.418,4.1620000000000354,2093
" We can recognize the problem, but we can also understand how to tackle it. ",722.418,726.569,4.150999999999954,2093
" In Brazil, the rate of deforestation  has been reduced by 70 percent over the last 10 years. ",726.569,733.803,7.234000000000037,2093
" How? By involving local communities,  investing in their agriculture and their economies,  by monitoring more carefully, by enforcing the law more strictly. ",733.803,745.3539999999998,11.55099999999993,2093
And it's not just stopping deforestation. ,745.3539999999998,747.2439999999999,1.8900000000001,2093
" That's of course of first and fundamental importance,  but it's also regrading degraded land, regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land. ",747.2439999999999,757.707,10.462999999999964,2093
I first went to Ethiopia in 1967. ,757.707,761.587,3.879999999999996,2093
"It was desperately poor. In the following years, ",761.587,764.062,2.4750000000000227,2093
 it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict. ,764.062,769.664,5.6019999999999746,2093
" Over the last few years, actually more than a few, Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly. ",769.664,775.423,5.759000000000015,2093
 It has ambitions to be a middle-income country  15 years from now and to be carbon neutral. ,775.423,782.061,6.6380000000000345,2093
" Again, I think it's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one. ",782.061,787.404,5.342999999999961,2093

So humans have lost on the Go board. What about the real world?,43.012,46.059,3.046999999999997,2781

" It's a lot less visible, but it's still a decision problem. ",50.48,54.361000000000004,3.881,2781

" And I think this could be, as some people have described it,the biggest event in human history. ",113.523,118.88799999999999,5.365000000000009,2781
" So why are people saying things like this,  that AI might spell the end of the human race? Is this a new thing?  Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking?Actually, no. This idea has been around for a while.",121.523,138.07299999999998,16.550000000000008,2781
" Here's a quotation:  ""Even if we could keep the machines in a subservient position, for instance, by turning off the power at strategic moments"" -- and I'll come back to that ""turning off the power"" idea later on --""we should, as a species, feel greatly humbled.""",138.097,153.53,15.432999999999993,2781
So who said this? This is Alan Turing in 1951.,155.035,158.483,3.4480000000000075,2781
" Alan Turing, as you know, is the father of computer scienceand in many ways, the father of AI as well.",159.15800000000004,164.99300000000005,5.835000000000008,2781
" So if we think about this problem,  the problem of creating something more intelligent than your own species, we might call this ""the gorilla problem,""  because gorillas' ancestors did this a few million years ago, and now we can ask the gorillas:  Was this a good idea?  So here they are having a meeting to discuss whether it was a good idea, and after a little while, they conclude, no,this was a terrible idea. ",166.097,191.063,24.966000000000008,2781
Our species is in dire straits. ,191.087,192.86900000000003,1.7819999999999825,2781

" (Laughter)  So this queasy feeling that making something smarter than your own species is maybe not a good idea --  what can we do about that?  Well, really nothing, except stop doing AI, and because of all the benefits that I mentioned and because I'm an AI researcher, I'm not having that. ",197.683,219.717,22.03400000000002,2781
I actually want to be able to keep doing AI.,220.141,222.609,2.4680000000000177,2781
So we actually need to nail down the problem a bit more.,223.47299999999998,226.15099999999998,2.6779999999999973,2781
" What exactly is the problem?  Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe?  So here's another quotation:  ""We had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machineis the purpose which we really desire."" ",226.175,240.45,14.275000000000004,2781
" This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960,  shortly after he watched one of the very early learning systemslearn to play checkers better than its creator.",241.14,251.271,10.131,2781
 But this could equally have been said by King Midas. ,253.46,257.334,3.8739999999999952,2781
" King Midas said, ""I want everything I touch to turn to gold,""and he got exactly what he asked for. ",257.941,263.572,5.631000000000029,2781
" That was the purpose that he put into the machine, so to speak,  and then his food and his drink and his relatives turned to goldand he died in misery and starvation. ",263.596,273.594,9.99799999999999,2781
" So we'll call this ""the King Midas problem"" of stating an objective which is not, in fact,truly aligned with what we want. ",275.302,283.409,8.107000000000028,2781
"In modern terms, we call this ""the value alignment problem.""",283.433,286.686,3.2529999999999863,2781
Putting in the wrong objective is not the only part of the problem.,289.905,293.39,3.4850000000000136,2781
There's another part. ,293.414,294.566,1.1519999999999868,2781
" If you put an objective into a machine,  even something as simple as, ""Fetch the coffee,"" the machine says to itself,  ""Well, how might I fail to fetch the coffee?Someone might switch me off. ",295.018,307.818,12.800000000000011,2781
"OK, I have to take steps to prevent that. ",308.503,310.89,2.3870000000000005,2781
I will disable my 'off' switch. ,310.914,312.82,1.906000000000006,2781
" I will do anything to defend myself against interferencewith this objective that I have been given.""",313.392,319.004,5.6119999999999655,2781
" So this single-minded pursuit  in a very defensive mode of an objective that is, in fact, not aligned with the true objectives of the human race --that's the problem that we face. ",319.028,330.842,11.81400000000002,2781
"And in fact, that's the high-value takeaway from this talk.",331.8649999999999,336.63199999999995,4.766999999999996,2781
" If you want to remember one thing, it's that you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.",336.65599999999995,341.41,4.754000000000018,2781
 (Laughter) It's very simple. Just remember that. Repeat it to yourself three times a day.,341.434,346.348,4.913999999999987,2781
" (Laughter)  And in fact, this is exactly the plot  of ""2001: [A Space Odyssey]""  HAL has an objective, a mission,  which is not aligned with the objectives of the humans,and that leads to this conflict. ",346.372,361.764,15.391999999999996,2781
"Now fortunately, HAL is not superintelligent.",362.352,365.321,2.9689999999999936,2781
" He's pretty smart, but eventually Dave outwits himand manages to switch him off. ",365.345,370.805,5.45999999999998,2781
But we might not be so lucky. ,374.686,376.305,1.6189999999999714,2781
 So what are we going to do?  I'm trying to redefine AI  to get away from this classical notion of machines that intelligently pursue objectives.,381.051,394.506,13.454999999999984,2781
There are three principles involved. ,395.57,397.36800000000005,1.7980000000000018,2781
" The first one is a principle of altruism, if you like, that the robot's only objective  is to maximize the realization of human objectives,of human values. ",397.392,409.651,12.258999999999958,2781
"And by values here I don't mean touchy-feely, goody-goody values.",409.675,413.005,3.330000000000041,2781
 I just mean whatever it is that the human would prefertheir life to be like. ,413.029,418.18300000000005,5.1539999999999955,2781
 And so this actually violates Asimov's law that the robot has to protect its own existence.,420.222,424.884,4.661999999999979,2781
It has no interest in preserving its existence whatsoever.,424.908,428.631,3.723000000000013,2781
"The second law is a law of humility, if you like.",430.278,434.046,3.7680000000000287,2781
And this turns out to be really important to make robots safe.,434.832,438.575,3.7429999999999954,2781
" It says that the robot does not know  what those human values are, so it has to maximize them, but it doesn't know what they are.",438.599,446.995,8.396000000000015,2781
 And that avoids this problem of single-minded pursuitof an objective. ,448.112,451.974,3.862000000000023,2781
This uncertainty turns out to be crucial. ,451.99800000000005,454.17,2.1719999999999686,2781
" Now, in order to be useful to us, it has to have some idea of what we want. ",454.584,458.978,4.393999999999949,2781
" It obtains that information primarily by observation of human choices, so our own choices reveal information about what it is that we prefer our lives to be like.",460.081,471.657,11.576000000000024,2781
So those are the three principles. ,473.49,475.173,1.6829999999999927,2781
" Let's see how that applies to this question of:""Can you switch the machine off?"" as Turing suggested.",475.19699999999995,480.32800000000003,5.130999999999972,2781
So here's a PR2 robot. ,481.931,484.051,2.1200000000000045,2781
" This is one that we have in our lab, and it has a big red ""off"" switch right on the back.",484.075,488.82300000000004,4.747999999999991,2781
" The question is: Is it going to let you switch it off? If we do it the classical way,  we give it the objective of, ""Fetch the coffee, I must fetch the coffee, I can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,""  so obviously the PR2 has been listening to my talk, and so it says, therefore, ""I must disable my 'off' switch, and probably taser all the other people in Starbuckswho might interfere with me."" ",489.399,512.112,22.712999999999965,2781
" (Laughter)  So this seems to be inevitable, right?  This kind of failure mode seems to be inevitable,and it follows from having a concrete, definite objective.",512.136,522.364,10.228000000000064,2781
" So what happens if the machine is uncertain about the objective?Well, it reasons in a different way. ",523.67,528.965,5.295000000000074,2781
" It says, ""OK, the human might switch me off,but only if I'm doing something wrong. ",528.9889999999998,533.8679999999998,4.879000000000018,2781
" Well, I don't really know what wrong is, but I know that I don't want to do it."" ",534.605,539.148,4.543000000000006,2781
So that's the first and second principles right there.,539.172,542.182,3.009999999999991,2781
"""So I should let the human switch me off."" ",542.206,545.5649999999998,3.358999999999924,2781
" And in fact you can calculate the incentive that the robot has to allow the human to switch it off,  and it's directly tied to the degree of uncertainty about the underlying objective.",546.5790000000001,557.76,11.181000000000038,2781
" And then when the machine is switched off, that third principle comes into play. ",558.8349999999998,563.6129999999998,4.77800000000002,2781
" It learns something about the objectives it should be pursuing,because it learns that what it did wasn't right.",563.637,569.256,5.619000000000028,2781
" In fact, we can, with suitable use of Greek symbols, as mathematicians usually do,  we can actually prove a theorem that says that such a robot is provably beneficial to the human.",569.28,580.59,11.31000000000006,2781
 You are provably better off with a machine that's designed in this waythan without it. ,580.6139999999998,585.687,5.073000000000093,2781
" So this is a very simple example, but this is the first stepin what we're trying to do with human-compatible AI.",586.095,592.928,6.83299999999997,2781
" Now, this third principle, I think is the one that you're probably scratching your head over.",595.515,601.908,6.393000000000028,2781
"You're probably thinking, ""Well, you know, I behave badly.",601.932,605.1709999999998,3.238999999999919,2781
I don't want my robot to behave like me. ,605.1949999999998,608.124,2.9290000000000878,2781
I sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge.,608.148,611.582,3.433999999999969,2781
"I do this and that."" ",611.606,612.774,1.1680000000000064,2781
There's all kinds of things you don't want the robot doing.,612.798,615.595,2.797000000000025,2781
"But in fact, it doesn't quite work that way.",615.619,617.6899999999998,2.0709999999999127,2781
 Just because you behave badly doesn't mean the robot is going to copy your behavior.,617.7139999999998,622.516,4.802000000000022,2781
" It's going to understand your motivations and maybe help you resist them,if appropriate. ",622.54,627.794,5.254000000000018,2781
But it's still difficult. ,629.064,630.528,1.4640000000000557,2781
" What we're trying to do, in fact,  is to allow machines to predict for any person and for any possible life that they could live,  and the lives of everybody else:  Which would they prefer?  And there are many, many difficulties involved in doing this;I don't expect that this is going to get solved very quickly.",631.16,652.8290000000001,21.668999999999986,2781
"The real difficulties, in fact, are us. ",652.8530000000001,655.4960000000001,2.643000000000029,2781

"In fact, some of us are downright nasty. ",660.148,662.4689999999998,2.3209999999999127,2781
"Now the robot, as I said, doesn't have to copy the behavior.",663.289,666.341,3.0520000000000214,2781
The robot does not have any objective of its own.,666.365,669.1560000000001,2.79099999999994,2781
It's purely altruistic. ,669.18,670.9169999999999,1.7370000000000803,2781

There are reasons for optimism. ,859.9830000000001,861.826,1.8430000000000744,2781
" One reason is, there is a massive amount of data. ",861.85,864.9010000000001,3.050999999999931,2781
 Because remember -- I said they're going to read everythingthe human race has ever written. ,864.925,869.289,4.364000000000034,2781
 Most of what we write about is human beings doing thingsand other people getting upset about it. ,869.313,873.975,4.6620000000000354,2781
So there's a massive amount of data to learn from.,873.9989999999999,876.3969999999998,2.3979999999999113,2781
 There's also a very strong economic incentiveto get this right. ,876.4209999999998,881.375,4.9540000000000655,2781
So imagine your domestic robot's at home. ,881.3989999999999,883.4,2.0009999999999764,2781
" You're late from work again and the robot has to feed the kids,and the kids are hungry and there's nothing in the fridge.",883.424,889.3380000000001,5.913999999999987,2781

" (Laughter)  And the robot hasn't quite learned the human value function properly, so it doesn't understand the sentimental value of the cat outweighs the nutritional value of the cat.",891.9910000000001,904.04,12.048999999999976,2781
" (Laughter)  So then what happens?  Well, it happens like this: ""Deranged robot cooks kitty for family dinner.""",904.064,913.24,9.176000000000043,2781
That one incident would be the end of the domestic robot industry.,913.2639999999999,917.787,4.522999999999911,2781
 So there's a huge incentive to get this rightlong before we reach superintelligent machines.,917.811,923.922,6.111000000000104,2781
 So to summarize:  I'm actually trying to change the definition of AIso that we have provably beneficial machines.,924.9860000000001,932.443,7.456999999999994,2781
" And the principles are:  machines that are altruistic,  that want to achieve only our objectives,  but that are uncertain about what those objectives are, and will watch all of us to learn more about what it is that we really want.",932.467,946.328,13.86099999999999,2781
"And hopefully in the process, we will learn to be better people.",947.2310000000001,950.79,3.558999999999969,2781

 We're going to stand here a bit because I think they're setting upfor our next speaker. ,957.654,961.9989999999999,4.345000000000026,2781
A couple of questions. ,962.023,963.561,1.5380000000000111,2781
So the idea of programming in ignorance seems intuitively really powerful.,963.585,969.038,5.453000000000088,2781
" As you get to superintelligence,  what's going to stop a robot  reading literature and discovering this idea that knowledge is actually better than ignorance  and still just shifting its own goals and rewriting that programming? Stuart Russell: Yes, so we want it to learn more, as I said,about our objectives. ",969.062,990.217,21.154999999999973,2781
" It'll only become more certain as it becomes more correct, so the evidence is there and it's going to be designed to interpret it correctly.",990.2410000000001,1000.479,10.237999999999943,2781
" It will understand, for example, that books are very biasedin the evidence they contain. ",1000.503,1005.966,5.463000000000078,2781
 They only talk about kings and princes and elite white male people doing stuff. ,1005.99,1011.211,5.2210000000000045,2781
" So it's a complicated problem,  but as it learns more about our objectives it will become more and more useful to us. ",1011.235,1019.314,8.078999999999949,2781
" CA: And you couldn't just boil it down to one law, you know, hardwired in:  ""if any human ever tries to switch me off, I comply. I comply."" ",1019.3380000000001,1028.8139999999999,9.476000000000113,2781
SR: Absolutely not. ,1028.838,1030.02,1.1820000000000164,2781
That would be a terrible idea. ,1030.0439999999999,1031.543,1.4990000000000236,2781
 So imagine that you have a self-driving car and you want to send your five-year-old off to preschool. ,1031.567,1037.911,6.344000000000051,2781
 Do you want your five-year-old to be able to switch off the car while it's driving along? Probably not. ,1037.9350000000004,1043.456,5.520999999999958,2781
So it needs to understand how rational and sensible the person is.,1043.48,1048.183,4.702999999999975,2781

"CA: All right. Stuart, can I just say, ",1057.1370000000004,1059.0030000000004,1.8659999999999852,2781

SR: Thank you. ,1063.764,1064.931,1.1669999999999163,2781
 Do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives?The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet. ,26.485,35.434,8.948999999999998,2782
They provide half the oxygen we breathe. ,36.048,38.449,2.400999999999996,2782
They moderate our climate. ,38.894,40.548,1.6540000000000037,2782
 And they provide jobs and medicine and foodincluding 20 percent of protein to feed the entire world population.,40.913,49.983000000000004,9.069999999999991,2782
 People used to think that the oceans were so vastthat they wouldn't be affected by human activities.,51.18899999999999,56.19,5.000999999999999,2782
" Well today I'm going to tell you about a serious reality that is changing our oceans called ocean acidification,or the evil twin of climate change. ",57.063,67.586,10.523000000000003,2782
 Did you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide that we have emitted to the atmosphere?  Now this is just another great service provided by the oceans since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gasesthat's causing climate change. ,68.758,85.141,16.38300000000001,2782
 But as we keep pumping more and more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere more is dissolving into the oceans. ,86.16799999999999,95.341,9.173000000000002,2782
And this is what's changing our ocean chemistry.,95.661,98.581,2.9200000000000017,2782
" When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, it undergoes a number of chemical reactions.",100.208,104.859,4.6510000000000105,2782
" Now lucky for you, I don't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today.",105.27799999999999,109.753,4.4750000000000085,2782
" But I'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean,the seawater pH goes down. ",110.246,115.95200000000001,5.705999999999988,2782
And this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity.,116.588,120.555,3.966999999999999,2782
And this whole process is called ocean acidification.,121.206,125.32799999999999,4.122,2782
And it's happening alongside climate change.,125.762,128.488,2.7259999999999986,2782
Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades.,129.214,133.317,4.103000000000009,2782
" This figure is an important time series in Hawaii, and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide,or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere. ",133.856,143.989,10.13300000000001,2782
And this is directly as a result of human activities.,144.1,147.346,3.2460000000000093,2782
 The line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean which you can see is increasing at the same rateas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began.,148.19799999999998,161.594,13.395999999999988,2782
The line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry.,161.785,164.792,3.0070000000000046,2782
" As more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean, the seawater pH has gone down, which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity.",164.817,174.456,9.638999999999982,2782
" Now in Ireland, scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification --scientists at the Marine Institute and NUI Galway.",176.043,182.93099999999998,6.888000000000004,2782
" And we, too, are seeing acidification at the same rateas these main ocean time-series sites around the world.",183.082,190.263,7.180999999999982,2782
So it's happening right at our doorstep. ,190.724,193.597,2.8729999999999905,2782
 Now I'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our datato monitor a changing ocean. ,194.428,199.864,5.436000000000007,2782
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter.,200.047,203.102,3.0550000000000064,2782
" So as you can imagine, in the North Atlantic we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions -- so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness,but we are collecting some very valuable data.",203.127,213.093,9.966000000000008,2782
" So we lower this instrument over the side of the ship, and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom that can tell us information about the surrounding water,such as temperature or dissolved oxygen.",213.45,223.933,10.483000000000004,2782
And then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles.,224.308,228.123,3.8149999999999977,2782
" So we start at the bottom, which can be over four kilometers deep just off our continental shelf, and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface.",228.29,237.33599999999998,9.046000000000019,2782
" We take the seawater back on the deck,  and then we can either analyze them on the shipor back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters.",237.733,245.668,7.935000000000002,2782
" But why should we care?  How is ocean acidification going to affect all of us?Well, here are the worrying facts. ",246.025,256.524,10.498999999999997,2782
" There has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percentsince pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities.",257.635,267.469,9.834000000000003,2782
" Unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions, we're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of 170 percentby the end of this century. ",268.509,281.595,13.085999999999954,2782
I mean this is within our children's lifetime.,282.571,284.904,2.333000000000027,2782
 This rate of acidification is 10 times fasterthan any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years.,286.363,298.427,12.063999999999965,2782
" So our marine life have never, ever experiencedsuch a fast rate of change before. ",298.918,306.083,7.1649999999999645,2782
So we literally could not know how they're going to cope.,306.409,310.308,3.8990000000000014,2782
" Now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago,which was much slower than what we're seeing today.",311.893,319.3769999999999,7.4839999999999804,2782
And this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species.,319.638,324.47900000000004,4.841000000000008,2782
" So is that what we're headed for? Well, maybe. ",325.749,329.278,3.5289999999999964,2782
 Studies are showing some species are actually doing quite wellbut many are showing a negative response. ,329.8889999999999,336.396,6.507000000000005,2782
" One of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases,the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease.",337.944,346.539,8.595000000000027,2782
" Now these ions are basically the building blocks for many marine species to make their shells,for example crabs or mussels, oysters. ",347.348,358.172,10.824000000000012,2782
Another example are corals. ,358.63199999999995,360.592,1.9600000000000364,2782
 They also need these carbonate ions in seawaterto make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs.,360.79,367.901,7.110999999999991,2782
" As ocean acidity increases  and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease,these species first find it more difficult to make their shells.",369.225,379.78,10.555000000000009,2782
"And at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve.",380.089,383.898,3.808999999999969,2782
"This here is a pteropod, it's called a sea butterfly.",385.07300000000004,388.136,3.062999999999988,2782
" And it's an important food source in the ocean for many species,from krill to salmon right up to whales. ",388.374,395.333,6.959000000000002,2782
 The shell of the pteropod was placed into seawaterat a pH that we're expecting by the end of this century.,396.246,403.205,6.959000000000002,2782
" After only 45 days at this very realistic pH,you can see the shell has almost completely dissolved.",404.062,414.04,9.978000000000009,2782
 So ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain --and right onto our dinner plates. ,414.413,420.793,6.380000000000052,2782
 I mean who here likes shellfish? Or salmon? Or many other fish species  whose food source in the ocean could be affected?These are cold-water corals. ,421.332,432.831,11.498999999999967,2782
" And did you know we actually have cold-water corals in Irish waters, just off our continental shelf? And they support rich biodiversity, including some very important fisheries.",432.97,443.0,10.03000000000003,2782
" It's projected that by the end of this century, 70 percent of all known cold-water corals in the entire oceanwill be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure.",443.714,458.129,14.414999999999964,2782
The last example I have are these healthy tropical corals.,461.708,465.366,3.658000000000016,2782
They were placed in seawater at a pH we're expecting by the year 2100.,465.93,470.67800000000005,4.748000000000047,2782
"After six months, the coral has almost completely dissolved.",472.342,477.856,5.514000000000009,2782
 Now coral reefs support 25 percent of all marine life in the entire ocean.,479.028,487.991,8.963000000000024,2782
All marine life. ,488.728,489.87800000000004,1.150000000000034,2782
So you can see: ocean acidification is a global threat.,490.926,495.251,4.324999999999989,2782
I have an eight-month-old baby boy. ,495.896,498.01800000000003,2.122000000000014,2782

" He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,  and the people in the neighborhood, and is a great resource in the community. ",800.8580000000001,807.8580000000001,7.0,36
" And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio,  the fruit merchant with his two kids here, and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know. ",807.8580000000001,818.8580000000001,11.0,36
 The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people. ,818.8580000000001,824.8580000000001,6.0,36
" So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,  from what Armstrong said, and from all these people, is that these are neighborhoods. ",824.8580000000001,832.8580000000001,8.0,36
The issue is not urban poverty. ,832.8580000000001,834.8580000000001,2.0,36
"The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing. ",834.8580000000001,837.8580000000001,3.0,36
" The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods --  this is a legitimate form of urban development --  and that cities have to engage these residents, because they are building the cities of the future. ",837.8580000000001,849.8580000000001,12.0,36
"I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem. ",24.858,29.858,4.9999999999999964,4
" We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed. ",29.858,38.858000000000004,9.0,4
 We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth  to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done. ,38.858000000000004,49.858000000000004,11.0,4
" And that is, instinctively we've gone out  and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived. ",49.858000000000004,64.858,15.000000000000007,4
 And I feel very strongly  that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids  that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it. ,64.858,77.858,13.0,4
 They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs. ,77.858,85.85799999999999,8.0,4
" We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future. ",85.85799999999999,92.85799999999999,7.0,4
" I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up. ",92.85799999999999,104.85799999999999,12.0,4

" (Laughter)  What we're looking forward to is --  (Applause)  what we're looking forward to  is not only the inspiration of our children,  but the current plan right now is not really even allowing  the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff. ",109.85799999999999,135.858,26.0,4

And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new. ,141.858,147.858,6.0,4
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's -- ,147.858,151.858,4.0,4
" the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,  is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later. ",151.858,161.858,10.0,4
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here. ,161.858,165.858,4.0,4
" And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young: three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds. ",165.858,173.858,8.0,4
What they look at is the most important thing. ,173.858,177.858,4.0,4
Let's take a snapshot at aviation. ,177.858,180.858,3.0,4
 And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened. ,180.858,186.858,6.0,4
" It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, ""Ooh, hey, I can do that."" There's only a few people that have flown ",186.858,194.858,8.0,4
"in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, ",194.858,199.858,5.0,4
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. ,199.858,203.858,4.0,4
" Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. ",203.858,211.858,8.0,4
" There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again. ",211.858,220.858,9.0,4
 The ones that flew and landed OK  because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. ,220.858,228.858,8.0,4
" So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,  in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, ",228.858,239.858,11.0,4
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. ,239.858,243.858,4.0,4
That has not happened at all in space flying. ,243.858,245.858,2.0,4
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. ,245.858,249.858,4.0,4
" Well, who was inspired during that time period?  Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation. ",249.858,257.858,8.0,4
 And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. ,257.858,268.858,11.0,4
"Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too. ",268.858,272.85799999999995,3.999999999999943,4
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there ,272.85799999999995,277.85799999999995,5.0,4
showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik. ,277.85799999999995,279.85799999999995,2.0,4
 And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; ,279.85799999999995,285.85799999999995,6.0,4
" we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?  But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts. ",285.85799999999995,295.85799999999995,10.0,4
" (Laughter)  If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,  and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport. ",295.85799999999995,312.85799999999995,17.0,4
 You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --  and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. ,312.85799999999995,323.858,11.000000000000057,4
" Well, what did I do when I was a kid?  I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. ",323.858,333.85799999999995,9.999999999999943,4
 I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force. ,333.85799999999995,338.85799999999995,5.0,4
 And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages. ,338.85799999999995,343.85799999999995,5.0,4
"And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them ",343.85799999999995,346.85799999999995,3.0,4
"is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, ",346.85799999999995,350.85799999999995,4.0,4
which is my company now. ,350.85799999999995,352.85799999999995,2.0,4
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. ,352.85799999999995,359.85799999999995,7.0,4
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. ,359.85799999999995,363.858,4.0,4
" The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. ",363.858,371.858,8.0,4
"Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service. ",371.858,375.858,4.000000000000057,4
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What? ,375.858,382.858,7.0,4
" The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, ",382.858,390.858,7.999999999999943,4
" take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool. ",390.858,394.858,4.0,4
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72. ,394.858,397.858,3.0,4
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961. ,397.858,402.858,5.0,4
"Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy. ",402.858,407.858,5.0,4
" Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow, have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else. ",407.858,416.858,9.0,4
These things tend to happen every 25 years. ,416.858,419.858,3.0,4
"40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement ",419.858,423.858,4.0,4
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing -- ,423.858,426.858,3.0,4
" by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. ",426.858,435.858,9.000000000000057,4
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. ,435.858,443.858,8.0,4
" Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it. ",443.858,449.858,5.999999999999943,4
"You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. ",449.858,453.858,4.0,4
"Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS. ",453.858,456.858,3.0,4
" But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it. ",456.858,463.858,7.0,4
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation -- ,463.858,466.858,3.0,4
I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none. ,466.858,469.858,3.0,4
" The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,  and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year. ",469.858,479.858,10.0,4
"In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed. ",479.858,488.858,9.0,4
There were only three or four flights in 2003. ,488.858,490.858,2.0,4
" In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave ",490.858,501.858,11.000000000000057,4
" with my little group of a couple dozen people  in order to get to a total of five, which was the number the same year back in 1961. ",501.858,510.858,8.999999999999943,4
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing. ,510.858,515.8580000000001,5.0,4
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne. ,515.8580000000001,518.8580000000001,3.0,4
This is a picture here taken from orbit. ,518.8580000000001,520.8580000000001,2.0,4
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. ,520.8580000000001,526.8580000000001,6.0,4
" We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done. ",526.8580000000001,534.8580000000001,8.0,4
 And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company. ,534.8580000000001,546.8580000000001,12.0,4
" Well, first of all, what's going to happen next? The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players. ",546.8580000000001,553.8580000000001,7.0,4
There's another one announced just last week. ,553.8580000000001,556.8580000000001,3.0,4
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital ,556.8580000000001,562.8580000000001,6.0,4
" is, there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this -- ",562.8580000000001,570.8580000000001,8.0,4
" three governments have been doing this for 45 years, and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. ",570.8580000000001,576.8580000000001,6.0,4
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. ,576.8580000000001,581.8580000000001,5.0,4
"It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. ",581.8580000000001,587.8580000000001,6.0,4
" I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. ",587.8580000000001,592.8580000000001,5.0,4
" But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. ",592.8580000000001,600.8580000000001,8.0,4
" And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool. ",600.8580000000001,607.8580000000001,7.0,4
 Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want. ,607.8580000000001,612.8580000000001,5.0,4
"Oh, it's going to be so much fun. ",612.8580000000001,614.8580000000001,2.0,4
" (Laughter) OK. My critics say, ""Hey, Rutan's just spending ",614.8580000000001,620.8580000000001,6.0,4
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires. ,620.8580000000001,625.8580000000001,5.0,4
"What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."" ",625.8580000000001,630.8580000000001,5.0,4
" And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 ",630.8580000000001,638.8580000000001,8.0,4
"and I bought it because I could say, ""I got a computer at my house and you don't. ",638.8580000000001,644.8580000000001,6.0,4
"'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger."" OK. ",644.8580000000001,649.8580000000001,5.0,4
" (Laughter)  Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, but the home computer was for games. ",649.8580000000001,656.8580000000001,7.0,4
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for. ,656.8580000000001,660.8580000000001,4.0,4
" But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,  big development, big improvement and capability and so on, and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention. ",660.8580000000001,673.8580000000001,13.0,4
And the inventor is in this audience. ,673.8580000000001,675.8580000000001,2.0,4
" Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,  something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --  a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,  our communication and, if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter) ",675.8580000000001,696.8580000000001,21.0,4
 And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes. ,696.8580000000001,704.8580000000001,8.0,4
So fun is defendable. ,704.8580000000001,707.8580000000001,3.0,4
" OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen. ",707.8580000000001,715.8580000000001,8.0,4
"And in it also brings up another point, right here. ",715.8580000000001,719.8580000000001,4.0,4
" There's a group of people that have come forward --  and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward  were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,  by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period. ",719.8580000000001,738.8580000000001,19.0,4
" Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,  which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. ",738.8580000000001,757.8580000000001,19.0,4
" These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,  and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area  of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --  areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,  and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually ",757.8580000000001,780.8580000000001,23.0,4
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. ,780.8580000000001,784.8580000000001,4.0,4
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. ,784.8580000000001,790.8580000000001,6.0,4
There were a couple of examples here. ,790.8580000000001,792.8580000000001,2.0,4
" The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, ",792.8580000000001,801.8580000000001,9.0,4
and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. ,801.8580000000001,806.8580000000001,5.0,4
" It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service. And we're stuck back here ",806.8580000000001,812.8580000000001,6.0,4
 with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s. ,812.8580000000001,819.8580000000001,7.0,4
But something is out there to inspire our kids now. ,819.8580000000001,823.8580000000001,4.0,4
" And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now. ",823.8580000000001,826.8580000000001,3.0,4
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. ,826.8580000000001,832.8580000000001,6.0,4
" Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket  and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before. ",832.8580000000001,843.8580000000001,11.0,4
" The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance  has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;  why do you need something better?  But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying  sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,  what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.

We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware ,883.8580000000001,887.8580000000001,4.0,4

There are several ways refugees come to this country.,289.164,291.68499999999995,2.520999999999958,45969
One is through the US Refugee Admissions Program.,291.70899999999995,294.513,2.8040000000000305,45969
" Through that program, the US identifies and selects refugees abroadand brings them to the United States. ",294.53700000000003,300.747,6.20999999999998,45969

Another way that refugees come to this country is by seeking asylum.,318.878,322.645,3.766999999999996,45969
 Asylum seekers are people who present themselves at a borderand say that they'll be persecuted if they're sent back home.,322.66900000000004,329.282,6.613,45969
 An asylum seeker is simply somebody who's going through the process in the United States to prove that they meet the refugee definition.,329.306,336.265,6.959000000000002,45969
And it's never been more difficult to seek asylum.,338.265,341.701,3.435999999999978,45969
" Border guards are telling people when they show up at our bordersthat our country's full, that they simply can't apply.",341.725,347.376,5.6510000000000105,45969

" Under a new program,  with the kind of Orwellian title ""Migrant Protection Protocols,"" refugees are told they have to wait in Mexico while their cases make their way through the courts in the United States,and this can take months or years. ",349.686,365.168,15.482000000000026,45969

" Many were toddlers, and at least one was a six-year-old blind girl.",380.581,385.415,4.834000000000003,45969
And this is still going on. ,385.439,386.92,1.4809999999999943,45969
 We spend billions to detain people in what are virtually prisonswho have committed no crime. ,387.67,393.099,5.429000000000031,45969
And family separation has become the hallmark of our immigration system.,395.657,401.088,5.430999999999983,45969

Humanitarian aid is also critical. ,501.346,503.751,2.4049999999999727,45969
 The amount of support we provide to countries in Central America that are sending refugees and migrants is a tiny fraction of the amount we spend on enforcement and detention.,503.775,514.448,10.673000000000002,45969

" Now, they went to the surface of the moon, they famously made the great leap for mankind.",31.191000000000006,37.084,5.893000000000002,45970

It's rightly celebrated as a moment that in America we say is a triumph.,41.525,46.959,5.4339999999999975,45970
We think it was this amazing accomplishment.,46.983000000000004,49.959,2.9759999999999986,45970
"They didn't just leave behind this flag, though.",49.983000000000004,52.251000000000005,2.2680000000000007,45970
They also left behind a plaque. ,52.275,53.752,1.4769999999999968,45970
" This plaque is a beautiful object, and one that I want to talk to you a little bit about.",53.776,58.001000000000005,4.225000000000001,45970
" First, you might notice that there's two globes,representing all of earth. ",58.025,61.542,3.517000000000003,45970
" And then there's this beautiful statement: ""We came in peace for all mankind."" ",61.566,65.292,3.7260000000000066,45970
" Now, at first, this is just nice poetic language,but it's also set in a typeface that's perfect for this moment.",65.316,72.292,6.975999999999999,45970
"It seems industrial, it seems engineered. ",72.316,75.501,3.1850000000000023,45970
 It also is the best possible name you could come up with for something on the moon: Futura.,75.525,80.917,5.391999999999997,45970
" Now, I want to talk to you about fonts, and why this typeface is perfect for this moment.",80.941,85.167,4.225999999999999,45970
But it's actually more than just ceremonial.,85.191,87.275,2.084000000000003,45970
" Now, when all of you arrived here today, you actually had to think about fonts. ",88.10799999999999,93.501,5.393000000000002,45970
" You might not realize it, but you're all unconscious experts on typography.",93.525,97.792,4.266999999999996,45970
" Typography is the study of how fonts inhabit our world,they're the visual language of the words we use.",97.816,106.10799999999999,8.292000000000002,45970
"Here's the thing that's funny about this, though.",106.85799999999999,109.167,2.308999999999997,45970
" I know you're probably not like me, you're not a font nerd, maybe some of you are, but if you're not, that's alright, because I might spend hours every day  trying to pick the perfect typeface for the perfect project, or I might spend thousands of dollars every year,trying to get ones with the right features.",109.191,123.959,14.767999999999999,45970
"But all of you actually spend hours every day, evaluating fonts.",123.98299999999999,127.126,3.1430000000000007,45970
"If you don't believe me, think about how you got here.",127.15,129.709,2.558999999999997,45970
" Each of you had to judge by the signs  and maybe even on your phone, which signals to trust and which to ignore.",129.733,136.459,6.725999999999999,45970
You were evaluating fonts. ,136.483,137.751,1.268000000000001,45970
" Or maybe when you're just buying a new product, you have to think about whether something is expensiveor cheap or hard to get or easy to find. ",137.775,146.292,8.516999999999996,45970
" And the funny thing about it is,  this may not seem extraordinary to you,  but the moment you see something out of place,you recognize it right away. ",146.316,153.501,7.185000000000002,45970
" (Laughter)  The thing I love about typography,  and why I love fonts and why I love Futura,is that, for me, what I study is everywhere.",153.525,163.792,10.266999999999996,45970
" Every street that I walk down, every book that I pick up,every thing that I read is filled with the thing I love.",163.816,171.667,7.850999999999999,45970
" Now, once you understand the history and what happens with typography,you actually have a history of everything before you.",171.69099999999997,179.417,7.725999999999999,45970
And this is the typeface Futura. ,179.44099999999997,181.667,2.225999999999999,45970
"As previously we've discussed, this is modernism in miniature.",181.69099999999997,185.084,3.3930000000000007,45970
" This is a way in which modernism infiltrated this country and became perhaps the most popular, or promiscuous typeface,of the twentieth century. ",185.108,193.12599999999998,8.017999999999999,45970
"""Less is more,"" right, these are the aphorisms of modernism.",193.15,196.459,3.308999999999997,45970
"And in the visual arts, the same thing happened.",196.483,198.75099999999998,2.2680000000000007,45970
" Let's focus on the essentials, focus on the basic shapes,focus on geometry. ",198.775,202.75099999999998,3.9759999999999986,45970
So Futura actually holds this to its core. ,202.775,205.50099999999998,2.7259999999999986,45970
" You might notice that the shapes inherent in Futurahave circles, squares, triangles. ",205.525,209.709,4.1839999999999975,45970
" Some of the shapes are all based on circles, like the O, D and C, or others have this pointed apex of the triangle.",209.733,216.62599999999998,6.893000000000002,45970
 Others just look like they might have been madewith a ruler or a compass. ,216.65,220.209,3.558999999999997,45970
"They feel geometric, they feel mathematic, precise.",220.233,222.917,2.683999999999997,45970
" In fact, this whole system carries through with the waythat the typeface was designed. ",222.94099999999997,227.084,4.143000000000002,45970
"To not look like it was made like other typefaces, to be something new.",227.108,230.459,3.3509999999999986,45970
"Here it is in the lightweight, the medium weight and the bold weight.",230.483,234.709,4.225999999999999,45970
The whole family has different things to commend to it.,234.733,237.709,2.9759999999999986,45970
" This was a conscious break from the past, something that looked like it was made by a machine, and not by hand.",237.733,243.00099999999998,5.268000000000002,45970
"When I say not made by hand, this is what I mean.",243.025,245.334,2.308999999999997,45970
" This is what we think about maybe, when you might create something with a calligraphic brush or a pen.",245.358,250.62599999999998,5.268000000000002,45970
That there's thicks and thins. ,250.65,252.084,1.4339999999999975,45970
" And even more traditional typefaces, say like a Garamond, holds vestiges of this old system  in which you can see the A where it get little bit thinner at the top and thicker down below, because it's trying to look like someone had made it by hand.",252.108,264.79200000000003,12.683999999999967,45970
" But Futura, in contrast,  is designed to look like no one had touched it at all, that this was made by a machine, for a machine age, for an industrial age. ",264.816,272.29200000000003,7.475999999999999,45970
" There's actually a sleight of hand here that Paul Renner, the designer who made this in 1927, employed.",272.316,278.126,5.810000000000002,45970
" If you look at the way in which  the circular shape joins with the vertical shaft,you'll notice that it tapers just every so slightly.",278.15,285.875,7.725000000000023,45970
" And this is one of hundreds of ways  in which this typeface was designed to look geometrically perfect,even though it's mathematically not. ",285.899,292.58399999999995,6.684999999999945,45970
" And this is what typeface designers do all the timeto make typefaces work, every day. ",292.60799999999995,297.66700000000003,5.059000000000026,45970
"Now, there were other designers doing this at the same time in Europe and America.",297.691,301.58399999999995,3.892999999999972,45970
" These are a few other excellent examples from Europe,trying to create something new for the new age, a new moment in time.",301.60799999999995,307.41700000000003,5.809000000000026,45970
" These are some other ones in Germany  that in some ways look very similar to Futura,maybe with higher waist or lower waist or different proportions.",307.441,314.501,7.060000000000002,45970
" Then why did Futura take over the world?  In this case, if you can read the titles there, some of these names don't quite roll off the tongue:Erbar, Kabel Light, Berthold-Grotesk, Elegant-Grotesk.",314.525,327.16700000000003,12.641999999999996,45970
" These aren't exactly household names, are they? And so when you compare that to Futura, you realize that this was a really good choice by the marketing team.",327.191,335.417,8.225999999999999,45970
" What's amazing about this name --  you know, what's in this name is that this is a namethat actually invokes hope and an idea about the future.",335.441,343.542,8.100999999999999,45970
" And this isn't actually the word for future in German, it wasn't a German name,  they actually picked something that would speak to a wider, larger audience, a universal audience.",343.566,352.08399999999995,8.517999999999972,45970
" And when you compare it to what was being done in America -- these are the typefaces from the same period in the United States in the 1920s, bold, brash, braggadocios. ",352.10799999999995,360.08399999999995,7.975999999999999,45970
 You almost think of this as exactly like what the stock market looked likewhen they were all going nuts in the 1920s.,360.10799999999995,365.709,5.600999999999999,45970
And you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary.,365.733,368.626,2.8930000000000287,45970
I want to step back and talk about an example of the typeface in use.,368.65,372.834,4.183999999999969,45970
"So this is a magazine that we all probably know today, ""Vanity Fair.""",372.858,376.126,3.2680000000000287,45970
"This is what it looked like in 1929, in the summer.",376.15,379.501,3.3509999999999986,45970
"And in many ways, there's nothing wrong with this design.",379.525,382.917,3.391999999999996,45970
This is absolutely typical of the 1920s. ,382.941,385.542,2.600999999999999,45970
" There's a photograph of an important person,in this case Franklin Roosevelt, then-governor of New York.",385.566,390.501,4.935000000000001,45970
"Everything seems centered, everything seems symmetrical.",390.525,393.167,2.641999999999996,45970
" There's still a little bit of ornamentation, so this is still maybe having some vestiges of the painted ladyand not fully modernistic. ",393.191,399.584,6.393000000000028,45970
But everything seems kid of solid. ,399.608,401.251,1.6430000000000289,45970
There's even drop caps to help you get into the text.,401.275,403.792,2.516999999999996,45970
" But this all changed very quickly and in October of 1929,a Berlin-based designer came and redesigned ""Vanity Fair.""",403.816,409.542,5.725999999999999,45970
And this is what it looks like with Futura.,409.566,412.751,3.1850000000000023,45970
" Instead of the governor  now we have a photograph of an abstract, beautiful setting,in this case, the ocean. ",412.775,419.084,6.308999999999969,45970
"Instead of drop caps, there's nothing at all.",419.108,421.334,2.225999999999999,45970
And replaced with a centered layout is now asymmetry.,421.358,425.417,4.059000000000026,45970
And it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine.,425.441,428.501,3.0600000000000023,45970
"In this case, even more dramatic asymmetry.",428.525,430.542,2.016999999999996,45970
" In this case, illustrations by Pablo Picasso, moving across the pageand breaking the gutter of the two pages. ",430.566,437.751,7.185000000000002,45970
And there's something even more radical. ,437.775,439.709,1.934000000000026,45970
"If you look closely at the Futura, you might notice something.",439.733,442.667,2.933999999999969,45970
" You might not pick it up at first, but there are no capital letters in the title or the captions on this page.",442.691,447.917,5.225999999999999,45970
" You might not think that's very radical,  but pick up any magazine, any book or go to any website,and I guarantee, you are not going to find it very easily.",447.941,455.334,7.393000000000028,45970
This is still a radical idea. ,455.358,457.751,2.393000000000029,45970
" And why is that radical?  When we think about what capital letters denote, they denote something important, whether it's our names, or our titles. ",457.775,466.042,8.266999999999996,45970
" Or maybe even just the name of our corporations,or maybe our trademarks. ",466.066,470.751,4.685000000000001,45970
"Actually, in some ways, America's the home of capitalization.",470.775,474.209,3.433999999999969,45970
We love putting capitals in everything. ,474.233,476.126,1.8930000000000289,45970
 (Laughter)  But think about how radical this would be to introduce a magazine where you're taking away all the capital letters.,476.15,484.126,7.975999999999999,45970
 This has maybe had the same political forcethat we now argue over things like pronouns in our society today.,484.15,489.959,5.808999999999969,45970
" In the 1920s, this is just shortly after Soviet Russia had a communist revolution.",489.983,496.191,6.208000000000028,45970
"And for them, this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America.",497.108,501.751,4.642999999999971,45970
" All lowercase letters meant that this was an egalitarian,complete lowering of everything into one equal playing field.",501.775,509.667,7.891999999999997,45970
Now this is still kind of a radical idea. ,509.691,511.667,1.975999999999999,45970
 Think about how often you do capitalize somethingto have more power or prestige to it. ,511.691,515.7919999999999,4.101000000000056,45970
So for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea.,515.816,520.001,4.1849999999999445,45970
"Now, other designers were doing other things with Futura.",520.025,523.2090000000002,3.1840000000000828,45970
" Others brought other ideas of modernism with it, whether it was interesting new illustration styles,or interesting new collage types of illustration.",523.2330000000001,530.7919999999999,7.559000000000082,45970
" Or even just new book covers, whether they were from Europe. ",530.8159999999998,535.001,4.185000000000058,45970
But here's the funny thing. ,535.025,536.876,1.850999999999999,45970
" In the 1920s, if you wanted to use a new typeface,you couldn't just go download it onto your computer.",536.9,541.7090000000001,4.808999999999969,45970
You actually had to have pieces of lead. ,541.7330000000001,543.9159999999998,2.1829999999999927,45970
" So for Americans who wanted to adopt this  and make it part of their own system,  something they could use in everyday typography, whether in ads or anything else, they actually had to have metal type. ",543.9399999999998,554.7919999999999,10.852000000000091,45970
" So being good American capitalists, what did we do?We made all sorts of copies. ",554.816,558.6669999999999,3.8509999999999986,45970
" Ones that had nothing to do with the name Futura, but looked identical to it, whether it was Spartan or Tempo. ",558.691,564.4590000000001,5.767999999999915,45970
" And in fact, by the time that World War II started,American corporations were actually trying to boycott Nazi goods.",564.4830000000001,570.6669999999999,6.184000000000082,45970
"But they said, ""Go ahead and use our copies.",570.691,573.1669999999999,2.475999999999999,45970
"Use 20th Century, use Spartan, use Vogue, use Tempo.",573.191,575.876,2.684999999999945,45970
"These are identical to Futura."" ",575.9,578.2090000000001,2.3089999999999695,45970
" And in fact, for most people, they didn't even learn the new names,they just still called it all Futura. ",578.2330000000001,583.2090000000001,4.975999999999999,45970
" So America took this typeface in, conquered it and made it its own. ",583.2330000000001,587.7919999999999,4.559000000000083,45970
" So by the time World War II finishes,  Americans are using this on everything,  whether it be catalogs, or atlases,  or encyclopedias or charts and graphs, or calendars, or even political material. ",587.8159999999998,601.8340000000001,14.018000000000026,45970
And even the logo for a new expansion football team.,601.8580000000001,604.9409999999998,3.08299999999997,45970
" And in fact, it was used even on some of the most important advertisingof the 20th century. ",605.9,610.626,4.725999999999999,45970
" So it's in this context  that when the US government was picking a typeface to use after World War II for new maps and new projects,they picked Futura. ",610.65,618.251,7.600999999999999,45970
" It wasn't an astounding choice, it wasn't a radical choice,it didn't have anything to do with communism.",618.275,623.251,4.975999999999999,45970
" But in this case, it was used on some of the most important maps, so this one, an air force map in 1962, or used for the maps in Vietnam in '66. ",623.275,630.691,7.416000000000054,45970
" And so it wasn't a surprise  that when astronauts first started the Mercury program, such as John Glenn orbiting the earth, that charts and maps that he was using were in Futura.",631.691,640.5419999999999,8.850999999999997,45970
" And in fact, by the time Mercury morphed into Apollo,it started getting used more and more for more things.",640.566,647.2090000000001,6.642999999999915,45970
" So in this case for a safety plan,  or even starting to get used on instrument panels,or navigational aids. ",647.2330000000001,654.2090000000001,6.975999999999999,45970
Or even on diagrams to show how the whole system worked.,654.2330000000001,657.3760000000001,3.1430000000000287,45970
" But here's the amazing thing, it didn't just get used for papers that they handed out to people.",657.4,661.9169999999999,4.517000000000053,45970
" It started to get used for an interface,  for an entire system that helped the astronautsknow how to use the machine. ",661.9409999999998,667.6669999999999,5.726000000000112,45970
NASA wasn't just one big corporation making everything.,667.6909999999998,671.5419999999999,3.8510000000001128,45970
" There was hundreds of contractors --  Boeing, IBM, McDonnell Douglas -- all making different machines. ",671.5659999999998,677.2919999999999,5.726000000000112,45970
 Now imagine if astronauts had to use different typefaces and different systemsfor each component they had in the space shuttles.,677.316,684.4169999999999,7.100999999999999,45970
 This would have been impossible to navigate and there would have been a cognitive overloadevery time they had to open up a new system.,684.441,690.7510000000001,6.309999999999945,45970
" So in this case, Futura being used on the interfacehelped them navigate complexity and make it more clear.",690.775,696.9169999999999,6.142000000000053,45970
" And it wasn't just used on buttons, it was used on labels, and it was used on their food rations, and it was used on their tool kits. ",696.941,704.1260000000001,7.184999999999945,45970
It was used on knobs and levers to tell them what to do.,704.15,708.209,4.058999999999969,45970
" In fact, maybe even some of the places  where they needed to have things that were complex be more simple to them, instructions were printed entirely in Futura,so that they could know what to do with that one moment.",708.2330000000001,718.834,10.601,45970
" They didn't have to remember everything in their head,they could have it out there in the world to see and refer to.",718.8580000000001,724.3760000000001,5.518000000000028,45970
" In this case, Futura helped make that system, which was already a very difficult and complex system,a little less complex. ",724.4,731.275,6.875,45970
" In fact, the very first or last thing an astronaut might have seen when they were entering or exiting the spacecraftwould have been in Futura. ",731.9409999999998,738.709,6.768000000000028,45970
 One of my favorite examples of how Futura worked in this wayis actually this camera. ,738.7330000000001,743.209,4.475999999999999,45970
This is a Hasselblad that was made by the Swedish company.,743.2330000000001,747.459,4.225999999999999,45970
" It's a perfectly good camera, some of you might have used one,it's prized by photographers as a really great camera.",747.4830000000001,754.2919999999999,6.809000000000082,45970
" And you might notice, if you know anything about cameras,that there's some modifications made to it.",754.316,759.084,4.7679999999999145,45970
" In this case, there are stickers placed all over the film canisters,or other parts of the camera here. ",759.1080000000001,765.084,5.975999999999999,45970
" What this enabled NASA to do, was make something really great out of the astronauts.",765.1080000000001,770.6669999999999,5.559000000000084,45970
"They're not photographers, they're not experts in art.",770.6909999999998,773.3760000000001,2.685000000000059,45970
 But they could ensure that they would know how to use this camerabecause of the labels placed there in Futura.,773.4,778.7510000000001,5.350999999999999,45970
" So in this case,  Futura acquired and made sure that they had legitimacywith the things they were using. ",778.775,785.5010000000001,6.725999999999999,45970
In this case to not take off the film before it would expose.,785.525,788.6669999999999,3.1420000000000528,45970
" Which, in this case, we would have never hadsome of the amazing photos we had without this label.",788.6909999999998,793.334,4.643000000000028,45970
" When we see something as decorative as this, a ceremonial patch, or something like this plaque on the moon,  we realize that Futura was more than just something ceremonial,something more than something that had just been picked for its design.",793.3580000000001,808.959,15.601,45970
" In fact, Futura had authority, had legitimacy and had power because of this choice.",808.9830000000001,814.1669999999999,5.184000000000083,45970
There's one other thing I want to talk about in closing.,814.191,817.3760000000001,3.184999999999945,45970
And that is that Futura tells a story. ,817.4,820.8760000000001,3.4759999999999986,45970
"And this is what I love about typefaces, is that all of them tell stories.",820.9,825.084,4.183999999999969,45970
" And in this case, this typeface tells a very powerful story about assimilation, about something being taken into Americaand being made part of its culture. ",825.1080000000001,833.7919999999999,8.684000000000083,45970
" And that's one of the best and worst things America does, is we take things into our culture and we spit them out back againand claim them our own. ",833.8159999999998,840.959,7.143000000000028,45970
" And in this case, Futura mirrors exactly what happened with the technologyundergirding the whole system. ",840.9830000000001,846.2510000000001,5.268000000000028,45970
"Futura was a German typeface, taken in, made into an American commodity.",846.275,850.709,4.433999999999969,45970
" And so were the technologies: the rockets, the scientists all came from Germany as well.",850.7330000000001,854.959,4.225999999999999,45970
" So in some ways, this German typeface on an American plaqueperfectly mirrors what happened with the technology.",854.9830000000001,860.6669999999999,5.684000000000082,45970
" And in this case,  when you think about this story, you realize that typography on the moon represents legitimacy, represents authority,and this gave them, the astronauts, the power to get to the moon.",860.691,874.0419999999999,13.351,45970
Thank you. ,874.066,875.334,1.2679999999999154,45970
I'm an historian. ,25.413,27.025,1.6119999999999983,45972
And what I love about being an historian is it gives you perspective.,27.049,31.066000000000006,4.017000000000003,45972
"Today, I'd like to bring that perspective to education in the United States.",31.545,36.064,4.518999999999998,45972
 About the only thing people can agree on  is that the most strategic time for a child to start learningis early. ,36.58,44.729,8.149000000000001,45972
" Over 50 years ago,  there was a watershed moment in early education in the UScalled ""Head Start."" ",44.753,50.978,6.225000000000001,45972
" Now, historians love watersheds  because it makes it so easy to talk about what came beforeand what's happened since. ",51.446000000000005,58.506,7.060000000000002,45972
"Before Head Start, basically nothing. ",58.53,61.148999999999994,2.619,45972
" With Head Start, we began to get our nation's most at-risk children ready for school.",61.721000000000004,68.35300000000001,6.632000000000013,45972
" Since Head Start, we've made strides, but there are still 2.2 million children in the US",68.377,75.126,6.7490000000000085,45972
" without access to early learning, or more than half of the four-year-olds in the country.",75.15,80.702,5.5519999999999925,45972
That's a problem. ,81.471,83.113,1.641999999999996,45972
But the bigger problem is what we know happens to those children.,83.137,86.617,3.480000000000004,45972
" At-risk children who reach school without basic skills are 25 percent more likely to drop out,  40 percent more likely to become teen parentsand 60 percent less likely to go to college.",87.03800000000003,99.47399999999999,12.435999999999993,45972
" So if we know how important early education is, why aren't all children getting it?  There are barriers that the solutions we've come up with to datesimply can't overcome. ",100.136,111.66400000000002,11.528000000000004,45972
Geography: think rural and remote. ,112.196,114.956,2.7600000000000047,45972
Transportation: think working parents everywhere.,114.98,118.878,3.8980000000000095,45972
Parent choice: no state requires a four-year-old to go to school.,118.90200000000002,123.678,4.775999999999981,45972
 And cost: the average cost for a state to educate a preschooleris five thousand dollars a year. ,123.70200000000001,131.13299999999998,7.431000000000013,45972
 So am I just going to keep talking about problems?No. ,132.532,136.713,4.180999999999982,45972
" Today, I want to tell you about a cost-effective, technology-delivered,kindergarten-readiness program that can be done in the home.",136.737,146.01000000000005,9.273000000000025,45972
" It's called UPSTART, and more than 60,000 preschoolers in the US have already used it.",146.03400000000005,151.905,5.870999999999981,45972
" Now, I know what you might be thinking: here's another person throwing tech at a national problem.",152.536,158.44799999999998,5.912000000000006,45972
And you'd be partially right. ,158.96,160.607,1.6469999999999914,45972
" We develop early learning software designed to individualize instruction,so children can learn at their own pace. ",160.96,168.82000000000005,7.860000000000013,45972
" To do that, we rely on experts from fields ranging from reading to sociology to brain science development to all aspects of early learning,to tell us what the software should do and look like.",168.84400000000005,181.63,12.785999999999973,45972
Here's an example. ,181.65400000000002,182.942,1.2880000000000111,45972
" (Video) Zero (sings to the tune of ""Day-O""): Zero! Zero! Zero is the number that's different from the others.",182.96599999999998,193.387,10.420999999999992,45972
"Seagulls: Zero is a big, round ""O."" ",193.41099999999997,196.49099999999999,3.0800000000000125,45972
"Zero: It's not like one, I'm sure you'll discover.",196.515,200.82299999999998,4.307999999999994,45972
"Seagulls: Zero is a big, round ""O."" ",200.847,204.234,3.3870000000000005,45972
" (Laughter) Claudia Miner: That is ""The Zero Song."" ",204.25799999999998,208.21400000000003,3.955999999999989,45972
 (Laughter) And here are Odd Todd and Even Steven to teach you some things about numbers.,208.238,215.414,7.176000000000017,45972
" And here are the Word Birds,  and they're going to show you when you blend letter sounds together,you can form words. ",215.438,221.748,6.310000000000002,45972
" You can see that instruction is short, colorful and catchy,designed to capture a child's attention. ",222.145,228.789,6.6440000000000055,45972
 But there's another piece to UPSTART that makes it different and more effective.,229.824,234.75,4.925999999999988,45972
UPSTART puts parents in charge of their children's education.,234.774,239.074,4.300000000000011,45972
" We believe, with the right support, all parents can get their children ready for school.",239.459,247.082,7.623000000000019,45972
Here's how it works. ,247.91,249.86700000000002,1.9569999999999936,45972
This is the kindergarten readiness checklist from a state.,249.891,253.021,3.130000000000024,45972
And almost every state has one. ,253.045,255.321,2.275999999999982,45972
" We go to parents wherever they are, and we conduct a key in-person group training.",255.83900000000003,260.918,5.079000000000008,45972
" And we tell them the software can check every reading, math and science box, but they're going to be responsible for motor skills and self-help skills,and together, we're going to work on social emotional learning.",261.41900000000004,274.456,13.036999999999976,45972
" Now, we know this is working because we have a 90-percent completion rate for the program.",275.60799999999995,280.774,5.166000000000054,45972
" Last year, that translated into 13,500 children""graduating,"" with diplomas, from UPSTART. ",280.798,289.61,8.811999999999955,45972
And the results have been amazing. ,290.65,293.116,2.466000000000008,45972
 We have an external evaluation  that shows our children have two to three times the learning gainsas children who don't participate in the program.,293.14,304.426,11.286,45972
" We have a random control trial that shows strong evidence of effectiveness, and we even have a longitudinal study  that shows our children's gains last into third and fourth grade,the highest grades the children had achieved at the time.",304.45,317.54900000000004,13.098999999999991,45972
Those are academic gains. ,318.04900000000004,319.875,1.8260000000000216,45972
 But another study has shown that our children's social emotional gainsare equal to those of children attending public and private preschool.,319.899,328.10900000000004,8.209999999999981,45972
" The majority of the 60,000 children who have participated in UPSTART to datehave been from Utah. ",329.41900000000004,335.73900000000003,6.319999999999991,45972
 But we have replicated our results  with African-American children in Mississippi -- this is Kingston and his mother;  with English language learners in Arizona -- this is Daisy and her family;  with refugee children in Philadelphia -- this is my favorite graduation photo; and with Native American children from some of the most remote parts of the United States.,335.76300000000003,359.824,24.060999999999982,45972
"This is Cherise, and this is where she lives in Monument Valley.",360.305,364.356,4.051000000000045,45972
"Now, there are skeptics about UPSTART. ",365.83,368.816,2.9859999999999904,45972
Some people don't believe young children should have screen time.,368.84,372.562,3.7219999999999795,45972
" To them, we say:  UPSTART's usage requirement of 15 minutes a day, five days a week, is well within the hour-a-day recommended by the American Academy of Pediatricsfor four-year-olds. ",373.052,386.82800000000003,13.776000000000009,45972
" Some people believe only site-based preschool can work, and to them, we say: site-based preschool is great, but if you can't get a child there or if a parent won't send a child there, isn't a technology-delivered, results-based option a great alternative?And we love working with site-based preschools.",387.35900000000004,409.906,22.546999999999965,45972
" Right now, there are 800 children in Mississippi going to Head Start during the day and doing UPSTART at night with their families.",409.93,418.437,8.507000000000005,45972
 Our audacious idea is to take UPSTART across the country -- not to replace anything; we want to serve children who otherwise would not have access to early education.,420.22,433.61800000000005,13.398000000000026,45972
" We have the guts to take on the skeptics,  we have the energy to do the work, and we have a plan. ",434.798,440.774,5.975999999999999,45972
It is the role of the states to educate their children.,441.382,445.273,3.89100000000002,45972
 So first we will use philanthropy dollars to go into a state to pilot the program and get data.,445.297,451.746,6.449000000000013,45972
 Every state believes it's unique  and wants to know that the program will work with its childrenbefore investing. ,452.309,460.202,7.893000000000028,45972
 Then we identify key leaders in the state to help us champion UPSTARTas an option for unserved children. ,460.732,468.592,7.860000000000013,45972
" And together, we go to state legislatures  to transition UPSTART from philanthropy to sustainable and scalable state funding. ",468.616,477.695,9.079000000000008,45972
 That plan has worked --  (Applause) Thanks. ,478.341,486.191,7.849999999999965,45972
Thank you. ,486.215,487.4,1.1850000000000025,45972
" That plan has worked in three states to date:Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. ",487.42400000000004,493.896,6.471999999999981,45972
 We've also piloted the program in a number of statesand identified champions. ,493.92,499.15,5.230000000000018,45972
" Next, we're moving to states with the greatest geographic barriers to work the plan,  and then on to states that already have early education but may not be getting great academic resultsor great parent buy-in to participate. ",499.17400000000004,513.464,14.290000000000074,45972
" From there, we go to the states  that are going to require the most data and work to convince,and we'll hope our momentum helps turn the tide there.",513.488,523.875,10.386999999999944,45972
" We will serve a quarter of a million children in five years,and we will ensure that states continue to offer UPSTART to their children.",523.899,531.887,7.987999999999943,45972
" Here's how you can help:  for two thousand dollars,  we can provide a child with UPSTART, a computer and internet, and that child will be part of the pilot that makes certain other children get UPSTART in the future.",533.2090000000001,546.8380000000001,13.629000000000019,45972
 We also need engaged citizens to go to their governmentand say just how easy it can be to get children ready for school.,547.379,556.182,8.802999999999997,45972
" You wouldn't be here if you weren't an engaged citizen,so we're asking for your help. ",556.525,561.727,5.201999999999998,45972
" Now, will all of us this make UPSTART a watershed moment in early education?I believe together we can make it one. ",563.3539999999998,572.1709999999998,8.817000000000009,45972
 But I can tell you without a doubt  that UPSTART is a watershed moment in the life of a child who otherwise would not be ready for school.,572.639,581.1659999999998,8.52699999999993,45972
Thank you. ,581.1899999999998,582.356,1.1660000000000537,45972
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.,25.04,30.62,5.579999999999997,47
" So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.",30.644000000000002,38.354,7.710000000000001,47
" And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known for most of recorded history,  and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system, or our environment or whatever,  is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought -- and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.",38.378,68.28399999999999,29.90600000000001,47
"Nowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.",69.12100000000001,73.081,3.9600000000000084,47
" And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile,  and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,we've got nowhere else to go. ",73.67699999999999,88.23200000000001,14.554999999999993,47
" Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history,human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.",88.256,102.245,13.989000000000004,47
" As Stephen Hawking famously said,  we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.",102.26899999999999,115.662,13.392999999999999,47
" Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of sayingthat we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on.",116.79899999999999,126.90299999999999,10.104,47
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.,126.927,129.784,2.856999999999985,47
" And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.",129.808,142.155,12.347000000000007,47
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.,143.338,148.695,5.356999999999998,47
 (Laughter) And they are. ,148.719,151.454,2.7350000000000136,47
So let me start with the second one: typical.,152.191,158.69500000000005,6.504000000000019,47
" Well, is this a typical place?  Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction, and we see a wall and chemical scum --  (Laughter) and that's not typical of the universe at all.",159.42700000000002,176.68599999999998,17.259000000000018,47
" All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back,  and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all --all you see is a blue planet. ",176.71,186.49200000000002,9.781999999999982,47
" And if you go further than that,  you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe,because stars come in galaxies. ",186.516,199.01,12.494000000000026,47
" And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,is nowhere near any galaxies. ",199.034,205.834,6.799999999999982,47
" So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.",205.858,216.267,10.408999999999992,47
"And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.",217.237,222.618,5.381,47
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.,223.349,227.834,4.484999999999985,47
" To get to a typical place,  you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that,into intergalactic space. ",227.858,236.252,8.394000000000005,47
" And so, what does that look like -- ""typical?"" What does a ""typical"" place in the universe look like? Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality renderingof the view from intergalactic space. ",236.72799999999998,254.944,18.216000000000008,47
" Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?Well, not quite, not quite perfect. ",254.968,266.224,11.255999999999974,47
"You see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.",266.248,272.92900000000003,6.680999999999982,47
" It's so dark,  that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.",272.953,292.73400000000004,19.781000000000006,47
That's how big and how dark the universe is.,293.525,296.62,3.0950000000000277,47
" And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event, that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.",296.644,308.14,11.495999999999981,47
" (Laughter)  And yet, from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. ",308.164,314.181,6.016999999999997,47
 It's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero.,314.205,320.387,6.182000000000016,47
And it's very empty. ,320.411,322.269,1.858000000000004,47
 The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuumthat our best technology on Earth can currently create.,322.293,331.095,8.801999999999962,47
So that's how different a typical place is from this place.,331.50300000000004,337.88300000000004,6.379999999999996,47
And that is how untypical this place is. ,337.907,340.985,3.0779999999999745,47
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.,341.009,344.08,3.0710000000000264,47
" Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to?  Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us --is creating knowledge. ",346.201,359.973,13.771999999999993,47
" Well, what does that mean?  Well, look out even further than we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars.",359.997,371.445,11.448000000000036,47
" ""Quasars"" originally meant ""quasi-stellar object,""which means ""things that look a bit like stars.""",371.469,377.51300000000003,6.043999999999982,47
 (Laughter) But they're not stars. ,377.537,380.086,2.5489999999999777,47
And we know what they are. ,380.11,382.662,2.552000000000021,47
" Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsedtowards a supermassive black hole. ",384.43800000000005,394.29900000000004,9.86099999999999,47
" And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse  and some of the matter  back out in the form of tremendous jets,  which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- I think it's a trillion -- suns.",394.32300000000004,410.26,15.937000000000012,47
" Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlikethe physics of such a jet. ",412.783,419.26800000000003,6.485000000000013,47
We couldn't survive for an instant in it. ,419.292,421.579,2.2869999999999777,47
 Language breaks down when trying to describewhat it would be like in one of those jets.,421.603,426.94699999999995,5.344000000000051,47
" It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion,but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.",426.971,433.61300000000006,6.641999999999997,47
" (Laughter)  And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain, above all -- there's your reference -- what was happening there, in reality. ",433.63699999999994,460.80800000000005,27.17099999999999,47
" The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working modelof the other, the quasar. ",461.531,468.115,6.58400000000006,47
" Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model,  embodying the same mathematical relationshipsand the same causal structure. ",468.139,479.164,11.025000000000034,47
"Now, that is knowledge. ",479.18800000000005,481.226,2.038000000000011,47
" And if that weren't amazing enough,  the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the otheris increasing with time. ",481.916,489.941,8.024999999999977,47
That is the growth of knowledge. ,489.965,492.43800000000005,2.473000000000013,47
" So, the laws of physics have this special property, that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be can, nevertheless, embody the same mathematical and causal structureand to do it more and more so over time. ",492.462,509.26800000000003,16.805999999999983,47
So we are a chemical scum that is different.,509.926,513.201,3.275000000000034,47
This chemical scum has universality. ,513.225,516.714,3.4890000000000327,47
" Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision,the structure of everything. ",516.738,522.5600000000002,5.822000000000003,47
" This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essenceof the whole of the rest of physical reality.",522.5840000000002,535.149,12.56499999999994,47
" And so, far from being insignificant,  the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world.",535.173,547.34,12.167000000000028,47
" Now, how does the solar system -- our environment, in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe? Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis -- one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics,there's no special dispensation, no miracles involved.",548.289,574.775,26.48599999999999,47
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.,574.799,578.944,4.144999999999982,47
" One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.",578.9680000000001,585.5880000000001,6.6200000000000045,47
" Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer,and there's no known way of making a computer without matter.",585.612,592.572,6.9600000000000355,47
" We also need energy to make the computer, and most important, to make the media, in effect, onto which we recordthe knowledge that we discover. ",592.596,601.8340000000001,9.237999999999943,47
" And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations,is evidence. ",601.8580000000001,613.332,11.474000000000045,47
"Now, our environment is inundated with evidence.",614.1030000000001,617.1809999999998,3.0779999999999745,47
" We happened to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's law of gravity,about 300 years ago. ",617.2049999999998,624.636,7.431000000000041,47
" But the evidence that we used to do that  was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that, and we'll continue to fall for billions of years afterwards.",624.66,636.781,12.120999999999981,47
And the same is true for all the other sciences.,637.425,639.929,2.504000000000019,47
" As far as we know,  evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciencesis here just for the taking, on our planet.",639.953,649.132,9.178999999999975,47
 Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy. ,649.156,654.476,5.32000000000005,47
" Out in intergalactic space,  those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply -- as I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there.",654.5,666.211,11.711000000000013,47
" Or is it? Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.",667.3860000000001,672.971,5.5850000000000355,47
" (Laughter)  Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space,the same size as our home, the solar system.",672.995,682.5830000000001,9.587999999999964,47
" Now, that cube is very empty by human standards,but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.",682.607,690.834,8.226999999999975,47
" And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station, on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.",690.8580000000001,702.268,11.410000000000082,47
" Now, it's way beyond present technology  to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic spaceand form it into other elements and so on. ",702.6569999999998,712.0939999999998,9.437000000000012,47
" But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.",712.73,726.913,14.182999999999993,47
" If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply,because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.",726.937,733.807,6.8700000000000045,47
" And evidence?  Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.",733.831,747.0,13.168999999999983,47
" And with a more powerful telescope,  you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies,you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics.",747.54,755.9810000000001,8.441000000000031,47
" And locally there, you could build particle acceleratorsand learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.",756.005,762.0010000000001,5.995999999999981,47
 Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- (Laughter)  because it would take several hundred million yearsto get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.,762.025,774.1060000000001,12.081000000000017,47
" But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much -- (Laughter)  and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years. ",774.13,785.175,11.044999999999963,47
" (Laughter)  So, in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisitesfor the open-ended creation of knowledge. ",785.199,796.6,11.401000000000069,47
" Any such cube anywhere in the universe  could become the same kind of hub that we are,if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.",797.215,809.7669999999998,12.551999999999907,47
"So, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.",810.6160000000001,814.09,3.4740000000000464,47
" If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations,  then so is almost every other environment, so is the Earth. ",814.1139999999998,822.597,8.483000000000063,47
So is a polluted Earth. ,822.6210000000001,824.951,2.330000000000041,47
" And the limiting factor, there and here,  is not resources -- because they're plentiful --but knowledge, which is scarce. ",825.3789999999999,834.0980000000001,8.718999999999937,47
" Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and, I think, ought to --make us feel very special. ",834.5369999999998,842.87,8.333000000000084,47
" But it should also make us feel vulnerable, because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe,we won't survive them. ",842.8939999999999,853.834,10.93999999999994,47
" All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away, and we'll all be dead!

 And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chanceof surviving this century. ,873.317,878.11,4.793000000000006,47

" Now, I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in,  but I do agree with him about this: we can survive and we can fail to survive. ",881.293,893.7819999999998,12.488999999999919,47
" But it depends, not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.",894.423,900.834,6.4109999999999445,47

" So there was a case up in Scotland recently  where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school  banned homework  for everyone under the age of 13,  and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said,  ""What are you -- you know, our kids will fall"" -- the headmaster said, ""No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day.""

" We fill our head with distraction, with busyness,  so that we don't have to ask,  am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?  Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf?  Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason --  why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.

" So I thought today I'd do something a little different,  and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know, rather than giving you tried-and-true examples. ",253.858,261.858,8.0,74
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. ,261.858,263.858,2.0,74
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook. ,263.858,265.858,2.0,74
"And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick. ",265.858,268.858,3.0,74
"So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right? ",268.858,270.85799999999995,1.9999999999999432,74
"So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city. ",270.85799999999995,273.85799999999995,3.0,74
 One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world  for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. ,273.85799999999995,280.85799999999995,7.0,74
 We're already an urban planet; that's especially true in the developed world. ,280.85799999999995,284.85799999999995,4.0,74
" And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff. ",284.85799999999995,288.85799999999995,4.0,74
" If we can change the dynamic, by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... ",288.85799999999995,293.85799999999995,5.0,74
" Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. ",293.85799999999995,297.85799999999995,4.0,74
" And they are doing density, new density, better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. ",297.85799999999995,301.85799999999995,4.0,74
" They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars, which is a pretty great thing. ",301.85799999999995,306.85799999999995,5.0,74
So you have density. You also have growth management. ,306.85799999999995,308.85799999999995,2.0,74
You leave aside what is natural to be natural. ,308.85799999999995,311.85799999999995,3.0,74
This is in Portland. That is an actual development. ,311.85799999999995,314.858,3.000000000000057,74
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity. ,314.858,316.858,2.0,74
They've bounded the city with a line. ,316.858,318.858,2.0,74
"Nature, city. Nothing changes. ",318.858,320.858,2.0,74
"Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments. ",321.858,324.858,3.0,74
" You can start doing things like, you know,  transit systems that actually work to transport people, in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. ",324.858,332.85799999999995,7.999999999999943,74
You can also start to change what you build. ,332.85799999999995,334.85799999999995,2.0,74
" This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London, which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place. ",334.85799999999995,340.85799999999995,6.0,74
" We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,  that recycle much of their water,  that are much more comfortable than standard buildings, use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less. ",340.85799999999995,352.85799999999995,12.0,74
"Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much. ",352.85799999999995,356.85799999999995,4.0,74
" But once you also have people living  in close proximity to each other,  one of the things you can do is --  as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places. ",356.85799999999995,366.858,10.0,74
You can start to know where things are. ,366.858,368.858,2.0,74
"When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them. ",368.858,370.858,2.0,74
"When you share them, you end up using less. ",370.858,373.858,3.000000000000057,74
" So one great example is car-share clubs, which are really starting to take off in the U.S., ",373.858,377.858,4.0,74
"have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example. ",377.858,380.858,3.0,74
" If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,  do you really need your own car?  Another thing that information technology lets us do  is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using. ",380.858,394.858,13.999999999999945,74
" So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,  which I think is a pretty cool concept,  although I think it ought to work the other way around, that it gets brighter the more you don't use. ",394.858,404.858,10.0,74
"But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach. ",404.858,406.858,2.0,74
We could just re-label things. ,406.858,408.858,2.0,74
" This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods, and on the other hand, off. ",408.858,412.858,4.0,74
How we build things can change as well. ,412.858,414.858,2.0,74
This is a bio-morphic building. ,414.858,416.858,2.0,74
It takes its inspiration in form from life. ,416.858,420.858,4.0,74
" Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful, and also much more effective. ",420.858,424.858,4.0,74
" This is an example of bio-mimicry, which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. ",425.858,429.858,4.0,74
" In this case, you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective. ",429.858,435.858,6.000000000000057,74
There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable. ,435.858,438.858,3.0,74
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. ,439.858,441.858,2.0,74
We're starting to cover this more and more. ,441.858,443.858,2.0,74
" There's also neo-biological design,  where more and more we're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry. ",443.858,450.858,6.999999999999943,74
"So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae. ",450.858,453.858,3.0,74
" So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for  of how to take the cities most of us live in, and turn them into Bright Green cities. ",453.858,462.858,9.0,74
"But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. ",462.858,467.858,5.0,74
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. ,467.858,470.858,3.0,74
" And there's a statistic I often like to use,  which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days, a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days. ",470.858,478.858,8.0,74
" I was giving a talk about two months ago, and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me ",478.858,482.858,4.0,74
" and was really flustered, and he said, look, you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong. ",482.858,486.858,4.0,74
It's every seven days. ,486.858,488.858,2.0,74
" So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days, and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. ",489.858,496.858,7.000000000000057,74
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly. ,496.858,499.858,3.0,74
" They don't have existing infrastructure;  they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,  and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways. ",499.858,508.858,9.0,74
" So what do we need in order to make developing nation  megacities into Bright Green megacities? Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging. ",508.858,518.8580000000001,9.999999999999943,74
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. ,518.8580000000001,521.8580000000001,3.0,74
" The idea behind leapfrogging is that  if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation  where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need, there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right? ",521.8580000000001,535.8580000000001,14.0,74
" That you're much better off, almost universally, looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. ",535.8580000000001,542.8580000000001,7.0,74
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right? ,542.8580000000001,546.8580000000001,4.0,74
" All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones, skipping the whole landline stage. ",546.8580000000001,552.8580000000001,6.0,74
" If there are landlines in many developing world cities,  they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money. ",552.8580000000001,559.8580000000001,7.0,74
So I rather like this picture here. ,559.8580000000001,561.8580000000001,2.0,74
"I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone. ",561.8580000000001,565.8580000000001,4.0,74
"So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society. ",565.8580000000001,569.8580000000001,4.0,74
" We've heard all about this here this week,  so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. ",569.8580000000001,578.8580000000001,9.0,74
" The second thing is tools for collaboration,  be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration. Right? ",578.8580000000001,586.8580000000001,8.0,74
" When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate, you get different kinds of solutions. ",586.8580000000001,592.8580000000001,6.0,74
 And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital. Right? ,592.8580000000001,597.8580000000001,5.0,74
" So, you know, we have open source software, we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. ",597.8580000000001,605.8580000000001,8.0,74
And those things lead to things like this. ,605.8580000000001,607.8580000000001,2.0,74
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo. ,607.8580000000001,610.8580000000001,3.0,74
" This is a pretty remarkable program  using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,  and basically sort of abandoned buildings --  has put together a bunch of community centers  where people can come in, get high-speed internet access, learn computer programming skills for free. ",610.8580000000001,627.8580000000001,17.0,74
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. ,628.8580000000001,631.8580000000001,3.0,74
And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo. ,632.8580000000001,635.8580000000001,3.0,74
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter) ,635.8580000000001,638.8580000000001,3.0,74
So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion. ,639.8580000000001,644.8580000000001,5.0,74
" And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging  is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,  and re-categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room. ",644.8580000000001,657.8580000000001,13.0,74
"So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right? ",657.8580000000001,662.8580000000001,5.0,74
"You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. ",662.8580000000001,665.8580000000001,3.0,74
It's doing something new. There's new things happening. ,665.8580000000001,668.8580000000001,3.0,74
"There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things. ",668.8580000000001,671.8580000000001,3.0,74
" Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie ""City of God?"" Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it. ",671.8580000000001,677.8580000000001,6.0,74
"And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way. ",677.8580000000001,680.8580000000001,3.0,74
 You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. ,680.8580000000001,685.8580000000001,5.0,74
 These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda. ,685.8580000000001,689.8580000000001,4.0,74
" And who are waving their first books in the air, which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know? ",689.8580000000001,694.8580000000001,5.0,74
" So you also have the ability for people to start coming together  and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways, in ways that haven't happened before. ",694.8580000000001,707.8580000000001,13.0,74
" And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,  are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions, is we've got to craft new political realities. ",707.8580000000001,718.8580000000001,11.0,74
" And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities,  not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, what have you, but here at home as well. ",718.8580000000001,729.8580000000001,11.0,74
Another world is possible. ,729.8580000000001,731.8580000000001,2.0,74
And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right? ,731.8580000000001,735.8580000000001,4.0,74
We tweak that a lot. ,735.8580000000001,737.8580000000001,2.0,74
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here. ,737.8580000000001,740.8580000000001,3.0,74
" That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine  there being a different, vague possibility out there, but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. ",740.8580000000001,750.8580000000001,10.0,74
"We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil. ",750.8580000000001,753.8580000000001,3.0,74
" How many people knew of Lula before today? OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that. ",753.8580000000001,760.8580000000001,7.0,74
" So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,  but one of the things that he's doing is,  he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that  completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration. ",760.8580000000001,780.8580000000001,20.0,74
I would keep your eye on this fellow. ,780.8580000000001,782.8580000000001,2.0,74
" Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call ""serious play."" ",783.8580000000001,790.8580000000001,7.0,74
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. ,790.8580000000001,792.8580000000001,2.0,74
"This is from ""A Force More Powerful."" It's a little screenshot. ",792.8580000000001,795.8580000000001,3.0,74
" ""A Force More Powerful"" is a video game that,  while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage in non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter) ",795.8580000000001,802.8580000000001,7.0,74
"Here's another one. This is from a game called ""Food Force,"" ",802.8580000000001,805.8580000000001,3.0,74
which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp. ,805.8580000000001,808.8580000000001,3.0,74
" These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way  to a huge rise in, especially in the developing world, in people's interest in and passion for democracy. ",809.8580000000001,821.8580000000001,12.0,74
" We get so little news about the developing world  that we often forget that there are literally  millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt. ",821.8580000000001,834.8580000000001,13.0,74
"And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough. ",834.8580000000001,836.8580000000001,2.0,74
" But it's happening all over the place, and these tools are part of what's making it possible. ",836.8580000000001,840.8580000000001,4.0,74
" Now when you add all those things together,  when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools, you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get? ",840.8580000000001,848.8580000000001,8.0,74
"Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. ",848.8580000000001,852.8580000000001,4.0,74
"You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world. ",852.8580000000001,856.8580000000001,4.0,74
"You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India. ",856.8580000000001,858.8580000000001,2.0,74
It's the greenest building in the world. ,858.8580000000001,860.8580000000001,2.0,74
" You get grassroots solutions, things that work for people who have no capital or limited access. ",860.8580000000001,864.8580000000001,4.0,74
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains. ,864.8580000000001,868.8580000000001,4.0,74
You get access to distance medicine. ,868.8580000000001,870.8580000000001,2.0,74
 These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs  to access databases that have information that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner. ,870.8580000000001,878.8580000000001,8.0,74
You get new tools for people in the developing world. ,878.8580000000001,881.8580000000001,3.0,74
" These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,  for whom nightfall means darkness, to have a new means of operating. ",881.8580000000001,889.8580000000001,8.0,74
 These are refrigerators that require no electricity; they're pot within a pot design. ,889.8580000000001,894.8580000000001,5.0,74
And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems. ,894.8580000000001,897.8580000000001,3.0,74
 Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap and available to people in the developing world. ,897.8580000000001,901.8580000000001,4.0,74
Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight. ,901.8580000000001,905.8580000000001,4.0,74

 This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of California. ,39.858000000000004,43.858000000000004,4.0,77
" And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound, it actually turns out to be a very difficult project. ",54.858000000000004,60.858000000000004,6.0,77
" And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages. ",60.858000000000004,69.858,9.000000000000009,77
" And mantis shrimp are called ""mantis shrimp"" after the praying mantises, which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think, ",69.858,76.858,7.0,77
" well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds, to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes. ",76.858,82.85799999999999,6.0,77
" And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike, work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell. ",82.85799999999999,89.85799999999999,7.0,77
" So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties: there are spearers and smashers. ",89.85799999999999,94.85799999999999,5.0,77
"And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod. ",94.85799999999999,97.85799999999999,3.0,77
"And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead. ",97.85799999999999,102.85799999999999,5.0,77
"So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit, ",102.85799999999999,107.85799999999999,5.0,77
" this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species --  recorded at 1,000 frames a second, played back at 15 frames per second. ",107.85799999999999,113.85799999999999,6.0,77
" And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,  exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it. ",113.85799999999999,124.85799999999999,11.0,77
" Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, and these guys open up snails for a living. ",124.85799999999999,132.858,8.0,77
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack. ,132.858,137.858,5.0,77
" (Laughter) So, I'll play it one more time. ",137.858,140.858,3.0,77
"He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash. ",140.858,144.858,4.0,77
"And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner. ",144.858,151.858,7.0,77
" So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end, or it can smash with the heel. ",151.858,157.858,6.0,77
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike. ,157.858,160.858,3.0,77
" And so the first question that came to mind was,  well, how fast does this limb move? Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video. ",160.858,168.858,8.0,77
And I immediately came upon a problem. ,168.858,171.858,3.0,77
 Every single high-speed video system in the biology department at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement. ,171.858,178.858,7.0,77
We simply couldn't capture it on video. ,178.858,180.858,2.0,77
And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time. ,180.858,183.858,3.0,77
" And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department, looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology. ",183.858,191.858,8.0,77
And so we struck up a deal. ,191.858,193.858,2.0,77
" I said, ""Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system  that could capture these movements, you guys can film us collecting the data."" ",193.858,200.858,7.0,77
"And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter) ",200.858,202.858,2.0,77
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology -- ,202.858,206.858,4.0,77
 it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light. ,206.858,213.858,7.0,77
" And low light is a critical issue with filming animals, because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter) ",213.858,218.858,5.0,77
"So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here, ",218.858,223.858,5.0,77
"and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel. ",223.858,226.858,3.0,77
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail. ,226.858,229.858,3.0,77
" And the snail's wired to a stick, so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah. ",229.858,234.858,5.0,77
 (Laughter) I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here. ,234.858,239.858,5.0,77
" (Laughter)  So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second, and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times. ",239.858,251.858,12.0,77
" And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement. ",251.858,258.858,7.0,77
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards -- ,258.858,261.858,3.0,77
just a spectacular movement. ,261.858,264.858,3.0,77
" And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,  and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question. ",264.858,270.85799999999995,5.999999999999943,77
And we were in for our first surprise. ,270.85799999999995,273.85799999999995,3.0,77
 So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving  at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second all the way up to 23 meters per second. ,273.85799999999995,280.85799999999995,7.0,77
" And for those of you who prefer miles per hour, that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast. ",280.85799999999995,287.85799999999995,7.0,77
" In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum. ",287.85799999999995,294.85799999999995,7.0,77
 And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system. So our first surprise. ,294.85799999999995,301.85799999999995,7.0,77
 (Applause) So that was really cool and very unexpected. ,301.85799999999995,305.85799999999995,4.0,77
" So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?  And actually, this work was done in the 1960s by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows. ",305.85799999999995,313.858,8.000000000000057,77
" And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what's called a ""catch mechanism,"" or ""click mechanism."" ",313.858,319.858,6.0,77
" And what this basically consists of is a large muscle  that takes a good long time to contract, and a latch that prevents anything from moving. ",319.858,328.858,9.0,77
"So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens. ",328.858,330.85799999999995,1.9999999999999432,77
" And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up -- the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement. ",330.85799999999995,337.85799999999995,7.0,77
"And that's basically what's called a ""power amplification system."" ",337.85799999999995,340.85799999999995,3.0,77
" It takes a long time for the muscle to contract, and a very short time for the limb to fly out. ",340.85799999999995,344.85799999999995,4.0,77
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story. ,344.85799999999995,347.85799999999995,3.0,77
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes. ,347.85799999999995,351.85799999999995,4.0,77
But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History. ,351.85799999999995,355.85799999999995,4.0,77
" And if any of you ever have a chance,  backstage of the National Museum of Natural History is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what -- ",355.85799999999995,363.858,8.0,77
 (Laughter) this is serious business for me. ,363.858,366.858,3.0,77
" (Laughter)  So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,  whether it's a spearer or a smasher,  is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here. ",366.858,380.858,14.000000000000055,77
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse. ,380.858,382.858,2.0,77
It's a very beautiful structure. ,382.858,384.858,2.0,77
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas ,384.858,389.858,4.999999999999943,77
suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure. ,389.858,393.858,4.0,77
And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while. ,393.858,396.858,3.0,77
" And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. ",396.858,404.858,8.0,77
" There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism  in order to generate the amount of force that we observe, and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system. ",404.858,412.858,8.0,77
" So we thought, OK, this must be a spring -- the saddle could very well be a spring. ",412.858,417.858,5.0,77
" And we went back to those high-speed videos again, and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending. ",417.858,425.858,8.0,77
And I'll just do that one more time. ,425.858,428.858,3.0,77
 And then if you take a look at the video -- it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow. ,428.858,432.858,4.0,77
The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it ,432.858,434.858,2.000000000000057,77
"extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending. ",434.858,438.858,4.0,77
" So, we've had very solid evidence showing  that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends, and does, in fact, function as a spring. ",438.858,446.858,8.0,77
" The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a ""hyperbolic paraboloid surface,"" or an ""anticlastic surface."" ",446.858,453.858,6.999999999999943,77
" And this is very well known to engineers and architects, because it's a very strong surface in compression. ",453.858,458.858,5.0,77
" It has curves in two directions,  one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,  so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape. ",458.858,469.858,11.0,77
"So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists. ",469.858,473.858,4.0,77
" It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,  because it requires very little material to build this type of surface, and it's very strong. ",473.858,483.858,10.0,77
" So if you're going to build a thin gold structure, it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong. ",483.858,487.858,4.0,77
"Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects ",487.858,492.858,5.0,77
"is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure. ",492.858,495.858,3.000000000000057,77
 And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built that's 87 and a half feet spanwise. ,495.858,502.858,7.0,77
"It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points. ",502.858,505.858,3.0,77
 And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's --  he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points. ,505.858,518.8580000000001,12.999999999999945,77
 And all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods. ,518.8580000000001,524.8580000000001,6.0,77
 In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it. ,524.8580000000001,530.8580000000001,6.0,77
" So, very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out -- ",530.8580000000001,537.8580000000001,7.0,77
 the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring. ,537.8580000000001,542.8580000000001,5.0,77
"That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting. ",542.8580000000001,545.8580000000001,3.0,77
" So the next and final question was, well, how much force  does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails? And so I wired up what's called a load cell. ",545.8580000000001,554.8580000000001,9.0,77
" A load cell measures forces, and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it. ",554.8580000000001,559.8580000000001,5.0,77
" And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in. ",559.8580000000001,565.8580000000001,6.0,77
" So these animals are wonderfully aggressive, and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do ",565.8580000000001,571.8580000000001,6.0,77
" was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it. ",571.8580000000001,576.8580000000001,5.0,77
 And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. ,576.8580000000001,583.8580000000001,7.0,77
And we were able to get some force measurements out. ,583.8580000000001,586.8580000000001,3.0,77
"And again, we were in for a surprise. ",586.8580000000001,588.8580000000001,2.0,77
" I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking, no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal. ",588.8580000000001,594.8580000000001,6.0,77
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell. ,594.8580000000001,596.8580000000001,2.0,77
" So these are actually some old data  where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,  and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds generated by an animal about this big. ",596.8580000000001,606.8580000000001,10.0,77
" And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell  up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating well over 200 pounds of force. ",606.8580000000001,613.8580000000001,7.0,77
"And again, I think this will be a world record. ",613.8580000000001,616.8580000000001,3.0,77
" I have to do a little bit more background reading,  but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces. ",616.8580000000001,626.8580000000001,10.0,77
" And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system. ",626.8580000000001,633.8580000000001,7.0,77
But that was not the end of the story. ,633.8580000000001,635.8580000000001,2.0,77
"Now, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work. ",635.8580000000001,638.8580000000001,3.0,77
" And I got all these force measurements, and then I went and looked at the force output of the system. ",638.8580000000001,644.8580000000001,6.0,77
 And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks. ,644.8580000000001,650.8580000000001,6.0,77
And that was what really got me puzzled. ,650.8580000000001,654.8580000000001,4.0,77
"The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell. ",654.8580000000001,657.8580000000001,3.0,77
" But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later, and I didn't know what that was. ",657.8580000000001,665.8580000000001,8.0,77
" So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons, but not half a millisecond later. ",665.8580000000001,670.8580000000001,5.0,77
" Again, going back to those high-speed videos, there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on. ",670.8580000000001,676.8580000000001,6.0,77
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier. ,676.8580000000001,678.8580000000001,2.0,77
" There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel, and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell. ",678.8580000000001,684.8580000000001,6.0,77
" And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this, on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through. ",684.8580000000001,692.8580000000001,8.0,77
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light. ,692.8580000000001,697.8580000000001,5.0,77
Audience: Wow. ,697.8580000000001,699.8580000000001,2.0,77
" Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble. ",699.8580000000001,706.8580000000001,7.0,77
"And what that is, is cavitation. ",706.8580000000001,708.8580000000001,2.0,77
 And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon  which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds. ,708.8580000000001,717.8580000000001,9.0,77
" And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure, which results in the water literally vaporizing. ",717.8580000000001,724.8580000000001,7.0,77
" And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, and it's a very destructive process. ",724.8580000000001,730.8580000000001,6.0,77
"And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation ",730.8580000000001,735.8580000000001,5.0,77
" where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon, because it destroys boat propellers. ",735.8580000000001,740.8580000000001,5.0,77
" People have been struggling for years to try and design  a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate  and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show. ",740.8580000000001,751.8580000000001,11.0,77
" So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. ",751.8580000000001,763.8580000000001,12.0,77
" This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give  full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,  because I could never have done this in a million years -- one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen. ",763.8580000000001,777.8580000000001,14.0,77
" You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light, and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail. ",777.8580000000001,785.8580000000001,8.0,77
" So really, just an amazing image, slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds. ",785.8580000000001,792.8580000000001,7.0,77
" And again, we can see it in slightly different form there, with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces. ",792.8580000000001,799.8580000000001,7.0,77
"In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb. ",799.8580000000001,804.8580000000001,5.0,77
" So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:  what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually  the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble. ",804.8580000000001,814.8580000000001,10.0,77
" And these animals may very well be making use of  not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring, but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be ",814.8580000000001,825.8580000000001,11.0,77
making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail. ,825.8580000000001,829.8580000000001,4.0,77
"So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals. ",829.8580000000001,835.8580000000001,6.0,77
" So, one question I often get after this talk --  so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?  Because obviously, if it's breaking snails, the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does. ",835.8580000000001,846.8580000000001,11.0,77
" That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images, and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away ",846.8580000000001,851.8580000000001,5.0,77
their heel all the way to the flesh. ,851.8580000000001,853.8580000000001,2.0,77
 But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod is that you have to molt. And every three months or so ,853.8580000000001,859.8580000000001,6.0,77
"these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem. ",859.8580000000001,864.8580000000001,5.0,77
"Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem. ",864.8580000000001,868.8580000000001,4.0,77
"So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note. ",868.8580000000001,873.8580000000001,5.0,77
" (Laughter) Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know. ",873.8580000000001,880.8580000000001,7.0,77
" (Laughter)  So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring --  has actually been well known to biologists for a long time, not as a spring but as a visual signal. ",880.8580000000001,892.8580000000001,12.0,77
 And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods. ,892.8580000000001,900.8580000000001,8.0,77
" And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring. ",900.8580000000001,909.8580000000001,9.0,77
 And I think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon. ,909.8580000000001,913.8580000000001,4.0,77
 So these animals go into a molting period where they're unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft. ,913.8580000000001,919.8580000000001,6.0,77
And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct. ,919.8580000000001,922.8580000000001,3.0,77
"This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period ",922.8580000000001,929.8580000000001,7.0,77
" when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what. ",929.8580000000001,936.8580000000001,7.0,77
" And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more, they just signal. They wave their legs around. ",936.8580000000001,943.8580000000001,7.0,77
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing. ,943.8580000000001,947.8580000000001,4.0,77
" It's a well-established fact of these animals that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to. ",947.8580000000001,953.8580000000001,6.0,77
" And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots  in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information  about their ability to strike, or their strike force, and something about the time period in the molting cycle. ",953.8580000000001,965.8580000000001,12.0,77
 So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring. ,965.8580000000001,973.8580000000001,8.0,77
" So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators, Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this. ",973.8580000000001,981.8580000000001,8.0,77
" And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,  which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time, and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much. ",981.8580000000001,991.8580000000001,10.0,77

" It is, first of all, profoundly unequal:  half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;  a billion people with no access to clean water;  two and a half billion no access to sanitation;  a billion going to bed hungry every night;  one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria  and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- 80 percent of them under five years of age.

It is also unstable. ,117.85799999999999,120.85799999999999,3.0,85

" For those of you who saw ""An Inconvenient Truth,""  the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,  which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going if we don't do anything, here's where they could go. ",580.8580000000001,594.8580000000001,14.0,85
 And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory. ,594.8580000000001,598.8580000000001,4.0,85
We need a movie on those six categories. ,598.8580000000001,601.8580000000001,3.0,85
 And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it. ,601.8580000000001,607.8580000000001,6.0,85
So we're trying to do that. ,607.8580000000001,609.8580000000001,2.0,85
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do. ,609.8580000000001,612.8580000000001,3.0,85
"Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish. ",612.8580000000001,616.8580000000001,4.0,85
" It has been my experience in working in developing countries  that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say,  well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption --  I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption, and feeds corruption. ",616.8580000000001,638.8580000000001,22.0,85
" We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach. ",639.8580000000001,647.8580000000001,8.0,85
" Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,  and in a total of 62 countries, and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them. ",649.8580000000001,659.8580000000001,10.0,85
But the money is there to reach others. ,659.8580000000001,662.8580000000001,3.0,85
The systems are not there to reach the people. ,662.8580000000001,665.8580000000001,3.0,85
" So what we have been trying to do,  working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --  but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --  is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area  that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,  maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues  poor people are grappling with in the developing world,  that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,  and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world. ",665.8580000000001,707.8580000000001,42.0,85
" And the test is: one, will it do the job?  Will it provide high quality care?  And two, will it do it at a price  that will enable the country to sustain a health care system  without foreign donors after five to 10 years?  Because the longer I deal with these problems,  the more convinced I am that we have to --  whether it's economics, health, education, whatever -- we have to build systems. ",707.8580000000001,733.8580000000001,26.0,85
 And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight. ,733.8580000000001,740.8580000000001,7.0,85
" You think about whatever your life has been,  however many obstacles you have faced in your life,  at critical junctures you always knew  there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved. ",740.8580000000001,754.8580000000001,14.0,85
" In a world with no systems, with chaos,  everything becomes a guerilla struggle, and this predictability is not there. ",754.8580000000001,765.8580000000001,11.0,85
" And it becomes almost impossible to save lives, educate kids, develop economies, whatever. ",765.8580000000001,771.8580000000001,6.0,85
" The person, in my view,  who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, ",771.8580000000001,783.8580000000001,12.0,85
" who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,  Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,  but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru and other places around the world. ",783.8580000000001,796.8580000000001,13.0,85
" As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active --  and they serve a catchment area far greater  than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve -- since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one. ",796.8580000000001,814.8580000000001,18.0,85
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. ,814.8580000000001,819.8580000000001,5.0,85
" So when we decided to work in Rwanda  on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,  we wanted to build a healthcare network,  because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994, and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. ",819.8580000000001,837.8580000000001,18.0,85
"So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help. ",838.8580000000001,842.8580000000001,4.0,85
" Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti  and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,  number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country  that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,  and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world. ",843.8580000000001,863.8580000000001,20.0,85
And so we have set about doing that. ,864.8580000000001,868.8580000000001,4.0,85
"Now, we started working together 18 months ago. ",868.8580000000001,872.8580000000001,4.0,85
" And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,  which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda, with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people. ",872.8580000000001,886.8580000000001,14.0,85
" We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:  he develops and trains paid community health workers  who are able to identify health problems,  ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed  and take their medicine regularly,  who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,  providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it. ",886.8580000000001,922.8580000000001,36.0,85
" The procedures that make this work have been perfected,  as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years. ",922.8580000000001,933.8580000000001,11.0,85
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda. ,933.8580000000001,939.8580000000001,6.0,85
" And the results were so good that the Rwandan government  has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country, and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. ",939.8580000000001,952.8580000000001,13.0,85
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do. ,953.8580000000001,957.8580000000001,4.0,85
" We have about 500 people around the world  working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing -- just for transportation, room and board. ",957.8580000000001,966.8580000000001,9.0,85
And then we have others working in these other related programs. ,966.8580000000001,970.8580000000001,4.0,85
" Our business plan in Rwanda  was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,  who is an unusually gifted woman, but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. ",970.8580000000001,983.8580000000001,13.0,85
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s. ,983.8580000000001,988.8580000000001,5.0,85
 She was CEO of a successful e-venture --  she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures -- and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life. ,988.8580000000001,997.8580000000001,9.0,85
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay. ,997.8580000000001,1001.8580000000001,4.0,85
 She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. ,1001.8580000000001,1009.8580000000001,8.0,85
 And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. ,1009.8580000000001,1018.8580000000001,9.0,85
" When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition. ",1018.8580000000001,1028.858,10.0,85
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five. ,1028.858,1034.858,6.0,85
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent. ,1036.858,1039.8580000000004,3.000000000000228,85
 Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred  because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -- all entirely preventable and treatable. ,1039.8580000000004,1051.8580000000004,12.0,85

And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. ,1058.8580000000004,1063.8580000000004,5.0,85
" Within the first 18 months, the following things happened: we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS. ",1064.8580000000004,1072.8580000000004,8.0,85
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area. ,1072.8580000000004,1076.8580000000004,4.0,85
 Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment. ,1076.8580000000004,1085.8580000000004,9.0,85
That's lower than the figure in the United States. ,1085.8580000000004,1088.8580000000004,3.0,85
 Less than three-tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs. ,1088.8580000000004,1095.8580000000004,7.0,85

That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies. ,1104.8580000000004,1109.8580000000004,5.0,85
"About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000. ",1109.8580000000004,1113.8580000000004,4.0,85
" About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -- in just 18 months, up from zero when we started. ",1113.8580000000004,1121.8580000000004,8.0,85
 43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program  to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow. ,1121.8580000000004,1129.8580000000004,8.0,85
We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there. ,1129.8580000000004,1133.8580000000004,4.0,85
" Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide  that we have renovated along with four other clinics, complete with solar power generators, good lab technology. ",1133.8580000000004,1148.8580000000004,15.0,85

" And the most important thing is  because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,  we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda  for between five and six percent of GDP,  and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years. ",1159.8580000000004,1186.8580000000004,27.0,85
" And for those of you who understand healthcare economics  you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP  on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 -- but that's a story for another day. ",1187.8580000000004,1198.8580000000004,11.0,85
 (Laughter)  We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up. ,1199.8580000000004,1210.8580000000004,11.0,85
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho. ,1210.8580000000004,1216.8580000000004,6.0,85
" And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,  Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:  to save as many lives as quickly as we can,  but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world. ",1216.8580000000004,1234.8580000000004,18.0,85
" We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,  health administration and community health workers throughout the country,  to set up the information technology, the solar energy, the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure. ",1234.8580000000004,1247.8580000000004,13.0,85
" But over a five- to 10-year period,  we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out. ",1247.8580000000004,1254.8580000000004,7.0,85
" My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build  a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,  that can be a model for Africa, and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world. ",1255.8580000000004,1274.8580000000004,19.0,85

" It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda  where we also have a major economic development project  in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,  where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,  cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent  and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers.

" We could use some more help to do this,  but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system  in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,  one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.

" But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,  and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,  which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,  which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme --  but then it was quite new, especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade.

" What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us,  with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife  and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into  this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.

It's thrilling. ,307.85799999999995,308.85799999999995,1.0,91
" And at the same time, what keeps me up at night  is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 --  50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,  40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory, as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.

" And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,  it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,  is to build viable systems on the ground  that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.

Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year. ,533.8580000000001,537.8580000000001,4.0,91
300 to 500 million cases are reported. ,537.8580000000001,539.8580000000001,2.0,91

One: production is too low. Two: price is too high. ,561.8580000000001,564.8580000000001,3.0,91
Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located. ,564.8580000000001,569.8580000000001,5.0,91

three million by the end of the year. ,603.8580000000001,605.8580000000001,2.0,91
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year. ,605.8580000000001,607.8580000000001,2.0,91

" And so, when I told her about our idea --  that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,  and find a way for the women themselves to go out  and sell these nets to others --  she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up.

" We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,  and quickly did a prototyping on this, and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives. ",667.8580000000001,677.8580000000001,10.0,91
" She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts  together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,  despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things. ",677.8580000000001,689.8580000000001,12.0,91
" Not coming in with our own notions, because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. ",689.8580000000001,693.8580000000001,4.0,91
"First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty. ",693.8580000000001,696.8580000000001,3.0,91

Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives. ,710.8580000000001,714.8580000000001,4.0,91
 A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor. ,715.8580000000001,721.8580000000001,6.0,91
 I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history. ,722.8580000000001,729.8580000000001,7.0,91
" To do it right, we have to build business models that matter,  that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,  people all over the developing world who fit in this category, to do it themselves. ",729.8580000000001,741.8580000000001,12.0,91
"Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement. ",741.8580000000001,744.8580000000001,3.0,91
" It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,  that they want to make their own decisions;  they want to solve their own problems;  and that by engaging with them,  not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well. ",744.8580000000001,758.8580000000001,14.0,91
" And so I urge all of you to think next time  as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity  that we all have -- to make poverty history --  by really becoming part of the process  and moving away from an us-and-them world,  and realizing that it's about all of us, and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.

We are at a remarkable moment in time. ,12.231,16.256,4.025,2093
We face over the next two decades ,16.256,19.192,2.9360000000000004,2093
two fundamental transformations ,19.192,21.258000000000003,2.065999999999999,2093
that will determine whether the next 100 years ,21.258000000000003,24.3,3.0420000000000016,2093
is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. ,24.3,28.485,4.184999999999999,2093
Let me illustrate with an example. ,28.485,31.206999999999997,2.7220000000000013,2093
I first visited Beijing 25 years ago ,31.206999999999997,34.481,3.2740000000000014,2093
to teach at the People's University of China. ,34.481,37.507,3.025999999999996,2093
China was getting serious about market economics ,37.507,40.443000000000005,2.9360000000000004,2093
"and about university education, ",40.443000000000005,42.782,2.338999999999998,2093
so they decided to call in the foreign experts. ,42.782,47.273,4.491000000000007,2093
"Like most other people, ",47.273,48.878,1.6049999999999969,2093
I moved around Beijing by bicycle. ,48.878,51.693999999999996,2.8160000000000025,2093
"Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle, ",51.693999999999996,53.888000000000005,2.1939999999999955,2093
it was a safe and easy way to get around. ,53.888000000000005,57.195,3.3070000000000017,2093
Cycling in Beijing now ,57.195,58.559,1.3639999999999972,2093
is a completely different prospect. ,58.559,61.38,2.8210000000000046,2093
The roads are jammed by cars and trucks. ,61.38,64.523,3.1429999999999936,2093
The air is dangerously polluted ,64.523,66.322,1.7990000000000066,2093
from the burning of coal and diesel. ,66.322,69.934,3.6119999999999943,2093
"When I was there last in the spring, ",69.934,72.072,2.138000000000005,2093
there was an advisory for people of my age — ,72.072,74.85,2.777999999999992,2093
over 65 — ,74.85,77.28,2.430000000000007,2093
to stay indoors and not move much. ,77.28,80.149,2.869,2093
How did this come about? ,80.149,82.083,1.9339999999999973,2093
It came from the way in which ,82.083,84.50299999999999,2.4200000000000017,2093
Beijing has grown as a city. ,84.50299999999999,86.76799999999999,2.265000000000001,2093
"It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled, ",86.76799999999999,89.22800000000002,2.4600000000000084,2093
from 10 million to 20 million. ,89.22800000000002,91.404,2.175999999999988,2093
It's become a sprawling urban area ,91.404,93.097,1.6930000000000118,2093
"dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy, ",93.097,97.456,4.3589999999999955,2093
particularly coal. ,97.456,99.279,1.8229999999999933,2093
"China burns half the world's coal each year, ",99.279,103.554,4.275000000000007,2093
"and that's why, it is a key reason why, ",103.554,107.46799999999999,3.9140000000000015,2093
it is the world's largest emitter ,107.46799999999999,109.493,2.0249999999999915,2093
of greenhouse gases. ,109.493,112.40700000000001,2.914000000000001,2093
"At the same time, we have to recognize ",112.40700000000001,114.521,2.1140000000000043,2093
that in that period China has grown remarkably. ,114.521,117.705,3.183999999999997,2093
It has become the world's second largest economy. ,117.705,120.146,2.4410000000000025,2093
Hundreds of millions of people ,120.146,121.615,1.468999999999994,2093
have been lifted out of poverty. ,121.615,123.78,2.1650000000000063,2093
That's really important. ,123.78,125.861,2.081000000000003,2093
"But at the same time, the people of China ",125.861,128.178,2.316999999999993,2093
are asking the question: ,128.178,129.778,1.5999999999999943,2093
What's the value of this growth ,129.778,131.358,1.5800000000000125,2093
if our cities are unlivable? ,131.358,133.483,2.125,2093
"They've analyzed, diagnosed ",133.483,135.795,2.3119999999999834,2093
that this is an unsustainable path of growth ,135.795,139.135,3.3400000000000034,2093
and development. ,139.135,141.261,2.1260000000000048,2093
China's planning to scale back coal. ,141.261,143.59,2.329000000000008,2093
It's looking to build its cities in different ways. ,143.59,149.451,5.860999999999991,2093
"Now, the growth of China ",149.451,151.284,1.8329999999999984,2093
"is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change, ",151.284,155.00799999999998,3.724000000000018,2093
in the structure of the world economy. ,155.00799999999998,157.775,2.766999999999996,2093
"Just 25 years ago, the developing countries, ",157.775,160.497,2.7220000000000084,2093
"the poorer countries of the world, ",160.497,162.387,1.8899999999999864,2093
"were, notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people,",162.387,166.313,3.925999999999988,2093
they accounted for only about a third ,166.313,168.136,1.8230000000000075,2093
of the world's output. ,168.136,170.128,1.9919999999999904,2093
Now it's more than half; ,170.128,171.872,1.7440000000000282,2093
"25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds ",171.872,174.84300000000005,2.971000000000004,2093
from the countries that we saw 25 years ago ,174.84300000000005,177.94799999999998,3.1049999999999898,2093
as developing. ,177.94799999999998,179.22400000000002,1.275999999999982,2093
That's a remarkable change. ,179.22400000000002,180.822,1.5980000000000132,2093
"It means that most countries around the world, ",180.822,183.22400000000002,2.401999999999987,2093
"rich or poor, are going to be facing ",183.22400000000002,185.283,2.058999999999997,2093
the two fundamental transformations ,185.283,187.263,1.9800000000000184,2093
that I want to talk about and highlight. ,187.263,190.44799999999998,3.1850000000000023,2093
"Now, the first of these transformations ",190.44799999999998,192.46099999999998,2.013000000000005,2093
is the basic structural change ,192.46099999999998,195.06799999999998,2.6069999999999998,2093
of the economies and societies ,195.06799999999998,196.808,1.739999999999981,2093
that I've already begun to illustrate ,196.808,198.838,2.0300000000000007,2093
through the description of Beijing. ,198.838,202.34799999999998,3.5100000000000198,2093
Fifty percent now in urban areas. ,202.34799999999998,205.30700000000002,2.9589999999999748,2093
That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050. ,205.30700000000002,208.918,3.6110000000000175,2093
"Over the next two decades, we'll see ",208.918,211.179,2.260999999999996,2093
"the demand for energy rise by 40 percent, ",211.179,214.092,2.9129999999999825,2093
and the growth in the economy and in the population ,214.092,218.06599999999997,3.974000000000018,2093
"is putting increasing pressure on our land, ",218.06599999999997,221.048,2.9819999999999998,2093
on our water and on our forests. ,221.048,224.91400000000002,3.8659999999999854,2093
This is profound structural change. ,224.91400000000002,228.199,3.285000000000025,2093
If we manage it in a negligent ,228.199,229.774,1.5749999999999886,2093
"or a shortsighted way, ",229.774,232.393,2.619,2093
"we will create waste, pollution, congestion, ",232.393,236.259,3.866000000000014,2093
destruction of land and forests. ,236.259,239.80900000000003,3.5499999999999825,2093
If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated ,239.80900000000003,242.137,2.328000000000003,2093
"with my numbers — cities, energy, land — ",242.137,245.86,3.723000000000013,2093
"if we manage all that badly, ",245.86,247.739,1.878999999999991,2093
then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods ,247.739,249.82,2.080999999999989,2093
of the people around the world ,249.82,251.63099999999997,1.8110000000000068,2093
would be poor and damaged. ,251.63099999999997,254.62400000000002,2.9929999999999954,2093
"And more than that, ",254.62400000000002,256.44599999999997,1.8220000000000312,2093
"the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise, ",256.44599999999997,259.754,3.3079999999999927,2093
with immense risks to our climate. ,259.754,263.635,3.8809999999999714,2093
Concentrations of greenhouse gases ,263.635,265.682,2.047000000000025,2093
in the atmosphere are already ,265.682,268.6,2.9180000000000064,2093
higher than they've been for millions of years. ,268.6,272.23400000000004,3.6339999999999577,2093
"If we go on increasing those concentrations, ",272.23400000000004,275.872,3.6380000000000337,2093
we risk temperatures over the next century or so ,275.872,279.246,3.373999999999967,2093
that we have not seen on this planet ,279.246,280.863,1.6170000000000186,2093
for tens of millions of years. ,280.863,284.068,3.204999999999984,2093
We've been around as Homo sapiens — ,284.068,286.194,2.126000000000033,2093
"that's a rather generous definition, sapiens — ",286.194,289.365,3.1709999999999923,2093
"for perhaps a quarter of a million years, a quarter of a million.",289.365,292.168,2.8029999999999973,2093
We risk temperatures we haven't seen ,292.168,293.399,1.2309999999999943,2093
for tens of millions of years over a century. ,293.399,298.138,4.738999999999977,2093
That would transform the relationship ,298.138,300.20799999999997,2.07000000000005,2093
between human beings and the planet. ,300.20799999999997,304.437,4.228999999999985,2093
"It would lead to changing deserts, ",304.437,309.08799999999997,4.6510000000000105,2093
"changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes, ",309.08799999999997,312.278,3.1899999999999977,2093
"changing sea levels, ",312.278,313.51599999999996,1.2379999999999995,2093

"perhaps billions of people who would have to move, ",316.159,319.388,3.228999999999985,2093
"and if we've learned anything from history, ",319.388,321.311,1.9230000000000016,2093
that means severe and extended conflict. ,321.311,323.623,2.312000000000012,2093
And we couldn't just turn it off. ,323.623,325.501,1.8779999999999857,2093
You can't make a peace treaty with the planet. ,325.501,327.931,2.430000000000007,2093
You can't negotiate with the laws of physics. ,327.931,330.158,2.2270000000000323,2093
You're in there. You're stuck. ,330.158,331.87300000000005,1.714999999999975,2093
"Those are the stakes we're playing for, ",331.87300000000005,333.54900000000004,1.6759999999999875,2093
"and that's why we have to make this second transformation,",333.54900000000004,336.27099999999996,2.722000000000037,2093
"the climate transformation, ",336.27099999999996,337.911,1.6399999999999864,2093

"But the second of the transformations, ",348.42,350.31,1.8899999999999864,2093
"the climate transformations, we have to decide to do. ",350.31,354.42400000000004,4.113999999999976,2093
Those two transformations face us ,354.42400000000004,356.6430000000001,2.2190000000000505,2093
in the next two decades. ,356.6430000000001,358.8160000000001,2.1730000000000023,2093
The next two decades are decisive ,358.8160000000001,362.029,3.212999999999965,2093
for what we have to do. ,362.029,364.744,2.7150000000000314,2093
"Now, the more I've thought about this, ",364.744,366.26300000000003,1.5189999999999486,2093
"the two transformations coming together, ",366.26300000000003,368.36699999999996,2.104000000000042,2093
the more I've come to realize ,368.36699999999996,369.914,1.5469999999999686,2093
that this is an enormous opportunity. ,369.914,372.866,2.951999999999998,2093
It's an opportunity which we can use ,372.866,375.093,2.2270000000000323,2093
or it's an opportunity which we can lose. ,375.093,378.49,3.396999999999992,2093
And let me explain through those three key areas ,378.49,381.213,2.723000000000013,2093
"that I've identified: cities, energy and land. ",381.213,383.923,2.7099999999999795,2093
And let me start with cities. ,383.923,385.977,2.0539999999999736,2093
I've already described the problems of Beijing: ,385.977,390.01,4.033000000000016,2093
"pollution, congestion, waste and so on. ",390.01,392.856,2.846000000000004,2093
Surely we recognize that in many of our cities ,392.856,396.546,3.6899999999999977,2093
around the world. ,396.546,397.805,1.2590000000000146,2093

"You may have heard about Rathergate, ",134.858,136.833,1.9749999999999943,21

"realizing that the ""th"" in 111 ",139.988,144.00799999999998,4.020000000000009,21

We had both cared for patients with devastating diagnoses;,108.598,112.198,3.6000000000000085,2778

He wrote a memoir about facing mortality. ,121.87799999999999,124.398,2.519999999999996,2778
"I gave birth to our daughter Cady, ",125.27799999999999,127.43799999999999,2.1599999999999966,2778

We learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions.,130.678,135.31799999999998,4.640000000000015,2778
The day we took Paul into the hospital for the last time,137.278,140.85299999999998,3.5750000000000175,2778
was the most difficult day of my life. ,140.877,142.918,2.040999999999997,2778
When he turned to me at the end ,144.518,146.494,1.975999999999999,2778
"and said, ""I'm ready,"" ",146.518,148.998,2.4799999999999898,2778
I knew that wasn't just a brave decision. ,150.958,153.638,2.680000000000007,2778
It was the right one. ,154.238,155.558,1.3199999999999932,2778
Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR. ,156.638,159.518,2.8799999999999955,2778
"In that moment, ",160.31799999999996,161.814,1.496000000000009,2778
the most important thing to Paul ,161.838,164.438,2.5999999999999943,2778
was to hold our baby daughter. ,165.518,167.19799999999998,1.6800000000000068,2778
"Nine hours later, ",169.19799999999998,171.014,1.8160000000000025,2778
Paul died. ,171.03799999999998,172.238,1.1999999999999886,2778
I've always thought of myself as a caregiver --,175.918,178.174,2.256,2778

and taking care of Paul deepened what that meant.,180.278,183.078,2.800000000000012,2778
"Watching him reshape his identity during his illness,",184.078,187.69400000000002,3.6159999999999854,2778

talking together through his choices -- ,191.238,193.774,2.5360000000000014,2778
those experiences taught me ,193.798,195.21400000000003,1.4159999999999968,2778
"that resilience does not mean bouncing back to where you were before,",195.238,200.49400000000003,5.256,2778
or pretending that the hard stuff isn't hard.,200.518,203.19799999999998,2.680000000000007,2778
It is so hard. ,204.078,206.078,2.0,2778
"It's painful, messy stuff. ",207.118,210.398,3.280000000000001,2778

"And I learned that when we approach it together,",212.718,215.958,3.2399999999999807,2778
we get to decide what success looks like. ,217.078,220.75799999999998,3.6800000000000064,2778
"One of the first things Paul said to me after his diagnosis was,",223.03799999999998,226.358,3.3199999999999936,2778
"""I want you to get remarried."" ",227.318,228.838,1.5200000000000102,2778

(Laughter) ,233.798,236.334,2.5360000000000014,2778

"because it was so starkly honest, ",244.158,246.734,2.5760000000000223,2778

"Early in Paul's illness, ",250.718,252.41400000000002,1.695999999999998,2778

tasks that I had always avoided -- ,262.358,264.934,2.5760000000000223,2778
were not as daunting as they once seemed. ,264.958,267.238,2.2800000000000296,2778
I realized that completing an advance directive is an act of love --,267.998,272.357,4.3589999999999804,2778

"During that time, ",336.67800000000005,337.894,1.2160000000000082,2778
Paul wrote about his transition from doctor to patient.,337.918,340.718,2.800000000000012,2778

"and after a little while, they conclude, no,",173.44799999999998,176.79399999999995,3.3459999999999748,2781

(Laughter) ,184.783,186.423,1.6400000000000148,2781
So this queasy feeling that making something smarter than your own species,186.447,191.287,4.840000000000003,2781
is maybe not a good idea -- ,191.31099999999998,193.676,2.3649999999999807,2781
what can we do about that? ,194.446,195.937,1.491000000000014,2781
"Well, really nothing, except stop doing AI,",195.96099999999998,200.72799999999998,4.766999999999996,2781
and because of all the benefits that I mentioned,200.752,203.262,2.509999999999991,2781
"and because I'm an AI researcher, ",203.28599999999997,205.002,1.7160000000000082,2781
I'm not having that. ,205.02599999999998,206.817,1.7909999999999968,2781
I actually want to be able to keep doing AI.,207.241,209.709,2.4680000000000177,2781
So we actually need to nail down the problem a bit more.,210.57299999999998,213.25099999999998,2.6779999999999973,2781
What exactly is the problem? ,213.275,214.646,1.371000000000009,2781
Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe? ,214.67,217.916,3.2459999999999813,2781
So here's another quotation: ,219.356,220.854,1.4979999999999905,2781
"""We had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine",221.893,225.22799999999998,3.3350000000000084,2781
"is the purpose which we really desire."" ",225.252,227.55,2.2980000000000023,2781
"This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960, ",228.24,231.738,3.4979999999999905,2781

"OK, I have to take steps to prevent that. ",295.603,297.99,2.3870000000000005,2781

"in a very defensive mode of an objective that is, in fact,",309.171,312.116,2.9449999999999936,2781

"which is not aligned with the objectives of the humans,",343.298,347.03,3.7319999999999713,2781

But we might not be so lucky. ,361.786,363.405,1.6189999999999714,2781
So what are we going to do? ,368.151,369.74300000000005,1.5919999999999843,2781
I'm trying to redefine AI ,372.329,374.93,2.600999999999999,2781
to get away from this classical notion ,374.954,377.015,2.060999999999978,2781
of machines that intelligently pursue objectives.,377.039,381.606,4.567000000000006,2781
There are three principles involved. ,382.67,384.468,1.7980000000000018,2781
"The first one is a principle of altruism, if you like,",384.49199999999996,387.781,3.2889999999999877,2781
that the robot's only objective ,387.805,391.06699999999995,3.2620000000000005,2781
"is to maximize the realization of human objectives,",391.091,395.337,4.245999999999982,2781
of human values. ,395.361,396.751,1.3899999999999864,2781
"And by values here I don't mean touchy-feely, goody-goody values.",396.775,400.105,3.330000000000041,2781
I just mean whatever it is that the human would prefer,400.129,403.916,3.7869999999999777,2781
their life to be like. ,403.94,405.283,1.3430000000000175,2781
And so this actually violates Asimov's law ,407.32199999999995,409.631,2.3089999999999695,2781
that the robot has to protect its own existence.,409.655,411.98400000000004,2.329000000000008,2781
It has no interest in preserving its existence whatsoever.,412.00800000000004,415.731,3.723000000000013,2781
"The second law is a law of humility, if you like.",417.37800000000004,421.14599999999996,3.7680000000000287,2781
And this turns out to be really important to make robots safe.,421.93199999999996,425.675,3.7429999999999954,2781
It says that the robot does not know ,425.699,428.841,3.141999999999996,2781
"what those human values are, ",428.865,430.893,2.02800000000002,2781
"so it has to maximize them, but it doesn't know what they are.",430.917,434.095,3.1780000000000537,2781
And that avoids this problem of single-minded pursuit,435.212,437.838,2.626000000000033,2781
of an objective. ,437.86199999999997,439.074,1.2119999999999889,2781
This uncertainty turns out to be crucial. ,439.098,441.27,2.1719999999999686,2781
"Now, in order to be useful to us, ",441.684,443.32300000000004,1.6389999999999532,2781
it has to have some idea of what we want. ,443.347,446.07800000000003,2.7309999999999945,2781
"It obtains that information primarily by observation of human choices,",447.181,452.608,5.427000000000022,2781
so our own choices reveal information ,452.63199999999995,455.43300000000005,2.800999999999988,2781
about what it is that we prefer our lives to be like.,455.457,458.75699999999995,3.300000000000012,2781
So those are the three principles. ,460.59,462.273,1.6829999999999927,2781
Let's see how that applies to this question of:,462.29699999999997,464.615,2.317999999999984,2781
"""Can you switch the machine off?"" as Turing suggested.",464.639,467.42800000000005,2.7889999999999877,2781
So here's a PR2 robot. ,469.031,471.151,2.1200000000000045,2781
"This is one that we have in our lab, ",471.175,472.996,1.8209999999999693,2781
"and it has a big red ""off"" switch right on the back.",473.02,475.923,2.9030000000000205,2781
The question is: Is it going to let you switch it off?,476.499,479.11400000000003,2.6149999999999523,2781
"If we do it the classical way, ",479.13800000000003,480.603,1.4650000000000318,2781
"we give it the objective of, ""Fetch the coffee, I must fetch the coffee,",480.62699999999995,484.10900000000004,3.4819999999999713,2781
"I can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,"" ",484.13300000000004,486.713,2.580000000000041,2781
"so obviously the PR2 has been listening to my talk,",486.73699999999997,490.07800000000003,3.340999999999952,2781
"and so it says, therefore, ""I must disable my 'off' switch,",490.102,493.855,3.7530000000000423,2781
and probably taser all the other people in Starbucks,494.934,497.62800000000004,2.69399999999996,2781
"who might interfere with me."" ",497.652,499.212,1.5600000000000025,2781
(Laughter) ,499.236,501.298,2.062000000000012,2781
"So this seems to be inevitable, right? ",501.32199999999995,503.475,2.15300000000002,2781
"This kind of failure mode seems to be inevitable,",503.499,505.897,2.397999999999968,2781
"and it follows from having a concrete, definite objective.",505.921,509.464,3.5430000000000064,2781
So what happens if the machine is uncertain about the objective?,510.77,513.914,3.144000000000005,2781
"Well, it reasons in a different way. ",513.938,516.065,2.1270000000000664,2781
"It says, ""OK, the human might switch me off,",516.0889999999998,518.513,2.424000000000092,2781
but only if I'm doing something wrong. ,519.102,520.9680000000001,1.8659999999999852,2781
"Well, I don't really know what wrong is, ",521.705,524.18,2.474999999999909,2781
"but I know that I don't want to do it."" ",524.2040000000001,526.248,2.0440000000000964,2781
So that's the first and second principles right there.,526.2719999999999,529.2819999999999,3.009999999999991,2781
"""So I should let the human switch me off."" ",529.306,532.665,3.358999999999924,2781
And in fact you can calculate the incentive that the robot has,533.679,537.635,3.956000000000017,2781
"to allow the human to switch it off, ",537.659,540.1519999999999,2.493000000000052,2781
and it's directly tied to the degree ,540.1759999999999,542.09,1.9139999999999875,2781
of uncertainty about the underlying objective.,542.114,544.86,2.745999999999981,2781
"And then when the machine is switched off, ",545.935,548.884,2.949000000000069,2781
that third principle comes into play. ,548.908,550.7130000000001,1.80499999999995,2781
"It learns something about the objectives it should be pursuing,",550.737,553.799,3.062000000000012,2781
because it learns that what it did wasn't right.,553.823,556.356,2.5330000000000155,2781
"In fact, we can, with suitable use of Greek symbols,",556.38,559.95,3.57000000000005,2781
"as mathematicians usually do, ",559.974,562.105,2.130999999999972,2781
we can actually prove a theorem ,562.129,564.113,1.9840000000000373,2781
that says that such a robot is provably beneficial to the human.,564.137,567.69,3.5530000000001114,2781
You are provably better off with a machine that's designed in this way,567.7139999999998,571.5169999999999,3.8030000000001114,2781
than without it. ,571.5409999999999,572.7869999999999,1.245999999999981,2781
"So this is a very simple example, but this is the first step",573.195,576.101,2.9059999999999486,2781
in what we're trying to do with human-compatible AI.,576.125,580.028,3.9030000000000205,2781
"Now, this third principle, ",582.615,585.872,3.256999999999948,2781
I think is the one that you're probably scratching your head over.,585.896,589.008,3.11200000000008,2781
"You're probably thinking, ""Well, you know, I behave badly.",589.0319999999999,592.271,3.238999999999919,2781
I don't want my robot to behave like me. ,592.295,595.224,2.9290000000000878,2781
I sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge.,595.248,598.682,3.433999999999969,2781
"I do this and that."" ",598.706,599.874,1.1680000000000064,2781
There's all kinds of things you don't want the robot doing.,599.898,602.695,2.797000000000025,2781

Do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives?,13.585,17.918,4.332999999999998,2782
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet. ,19.788,22.534000000000002,2.7459999999999987,2782
They provide half the oxygen we breathe. ,23.148000000000003,25.549,2.401,2782
They moderate our climate. ,25.994,27.648000000000003,1.6540000000000001,2782
And they provide jobs and medicine and food,28.013,31.79,3.7769999999999975,2782
including 20 percent of protein to feed the entire world population.,32.139,37.083,4.943999999999996,2782
People used to think that the oceans were so vast,38.289,40.805,2.5159999999999982,2782
that they wouldn't be affected by human activities.,40.83,43.29,2.460000000000001,2782
Well today I'm going to tell you about a serious reality,44.163000000000004,47.449,3.2860000000000014,2782
"that is changing our oceans called ocean acidification,",47.474,52.106,4.632000000000005,2782
or the evil twin of climate change. ,52.321000000000005,54.68600000000001,2.365000000000002,2782
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide,55.858000000000004,61.28,5.422000000000003,2782
that we have emitted to the atmosphere? ,61.305,63.548,2.243000000000002,2782
Now this is just another great service provided by the oceans,63.928000000000004,67.566,3.638000000000005,2782
since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases,67.59100000000001,70.46000000000002,2.8690000000000135,2782
that's causing climate change. ,70.485,72.241,1.7560000000000002,2782
But as we keep pumping more and more and more,73.268,77.304,4.036000000000001,2782
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere ,77.33,79.822,2.4920000000000044,2782
more is dissolving into the oceans. ,79.988,82.441,2.453000000000003,2782
And this is what's changing our ocean chemistry.,82.76100000000001,85.681,2.9200000000000017,2782
"When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, ",87.30799999999998,89.696,2.388000000000005,2782
it undergoes a number of chemical reactions.,89.721,91.959,2.2379999999999995,2782
"Now lucky for you, ",92.37799999999999,93.54299999999999,1.1650000000000065,2782
I don't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today.,93.568,96.853,3.2850000000000112,2782
"But I'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean,",97.346,100.67,3.323999999999998,2782
the seawater pH goes down. ,100.695,103.052,2.3569999999999998,2782
And this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity.,103.68799999999999,107.655,3.966999999999999,2782
And this whole process is called ocean acidification.,108.306,112.428,4.122,2782
And it's happening alongside climate change.,112.86200000000001,115.588,2.7259999999999986,2782
Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades.,116.314,120.417,4.103000000000009,2782
"This figure is an important time series in Hawaii,",120.956,123.62899999999999,2.6730000000000023,2782
"and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide,",123.654,128.549,4.895000000000009,2782
"or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere. ",128.57399999999998,131.089,2.5149999999999864,2782
And this is directly as a result of human activities.,131.2,134.446,3.2460000000000093,2782
The line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide,135.298,139.329,4.031000000000007,2782
that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean,139.35399999999998,142.29,2.9360000000000066,2782
which you can see is increasing at the same rate,142.536,145.495,2.959000000000003,2782
as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began.,145.52,148.694,3.1739999999999777,2782
The line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry.,148.885,151.892,3.0070000000000046,2782
"As more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean,",151.917,154.743,2.8259999999999934,2782
"the seawater pH has gone down, ",154.768,157.014,2.2460000000000093,2782
which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity.,157.509,161.55599999999995,4.046999999999969,2782
"Now in Ireland, scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification --",163.143,167.213,4.069999999999993,2782
scientists at the Marine Institute and NUI Galway.,167.238,170.03099999999998,2.7930000000000064,2782
"And we, too, are seeing acidification at the same rate",170.18200000000004,174.33100000000005,4.149000000000001,2782
as these main ocean time-series sites around the world.,174.356,177.363,3.0070000000000046,2782
So it's happening right at our doorstep. ,177.824,180.697,2.8729999999999905,2782
Now I'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data,181.528,184.68599999999998,3.1580000000000155,2782
to monitor a changing ocean. ,184.71099999999998,186.96400000000003,2.252999999999986,2782
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter.,187.14700000000002,190.202,3.0550000000000064,2782
"So as you can imagine, in the North Atlantic",190.227,192.366,2.1389999999999816,2782
we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions --,192.391,194.99599999999998,2.605000000000018,2782
"so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness,",195.107,197.74,2.6330000000000098,2782
but we are collecting some very valuable data.,197.765,200.19299999999998,2.4280000000000257,2782
"So we lower this instrument over the side of the ship,",200.55,203.429,2.8789999999999907,2782
and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom,203.454,205.89,2.435999999999978,2782
"that can tell us information about the surrounding water,",205.915,208.588,2.6730000000000023,2782
such as temperature or dissolved oxygen.,208.613,211.033,2.420000000000016,2782
And then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles.,211.408,215.22299999999998,3.8149999999999977,2782
"So we start at the bottom, which can be over four kilometers deep",215.39,218.642,3.252000000000009,2782
"just off our continental shelf, ",218.667,220.524,1.8569999999999995,2782
and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface.,220.77,224.43599999999998,3.665999999999997,2782
"We take the seawater back on the deck, ",224.833,227.09400000000002,2.260999999999996,2782
and then we can either analyze them on the ship,227.229,229.608,2.379000000000019,2782
or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters.,229.63299999999998,232.768,3.134999999999991,2782
But why should we care? ,233.125,234.41099999999997,1.2860000000000014,2782
How is ocean acidification going to affect all of us?,234.609,239.053,4.443999999999988,2782
"Well, here are the worrying facts. ",240.71200000000002,243.62400000000002,2.9120000000000066,2782
There has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percent,244.735,250.537,5.8019999999999925,2782
"since pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities.",250.562,254.56900000000002,4.006999999999977,2782
"Unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions,",255.609,259.69599999999997,4.0870000000000175,2782
we're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of 170 percent,259.98900000000003,265.926,5.937000000000013,2782
by the end of this century. ,266.346,268.695,2.348999999999989,2782
I mean this is within our children's lifetime.,269.671,272.004,2.333000000000027,2782
This rate of acidification is 10 times faster,273.46299999999997,279.08099999999996,5.617999999999995,2782
than any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years.,279.106,285.527,6.420999999999991,2782
"So our marine life have never, ever experienced",286.0180000000001,290.389,4.370999999999982,2782
such a fast rate of change before. ,290.414,293.183,2.769000000000005,2782
So we literally could not know how they're going to cope.,293.509,297.408,3.8990000000000014,2782
"Now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago,",298.993,303.579,4.586000000000013,2782
which was much slower than what we're seeing today.,303.60400000000004,306.47700000000003,2.8729999999999905,2782
And this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species.,306.738,311.579,4.841000000000008,2782
So is that what we're headed for? ,312.849,314.436,1.5869999999999889,2782
"Well, maybe. ",315.228,316.378,1.1499999999999773,2782
Studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well,316.98900000000003,320.481,3.492000000000018,2782
but many are showing a negative response. ,320.506,323.496,2.990000000000009,2782
"One of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases,",325.04400000000004,329.091,4.0470000000000255,2782
the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease.,329.385,333.639,4.254000000000018,2782
Now these ions are basically the building blocks,334.44800000000004,337.35900000000004,2.9110000000000014,2782
"for many marine species to make their shells,",337.384,340.185,2.800999999999988,2782
"for example crabs or mussels, oysters. ",340.717,345.272,4.555000000000007,2782
Another example are corals. ,345.732,347.69199999999995,1.9600000000000364,2782
They also need these carbonate ions in seawater,347.89,351.07099999999997,3.18100000000004,2782
to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs.,351.096,355.001,3.9049999999999727,2782
As ocean acidity increases ,356.325,358.515,2.1899999999999977,2782
"and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease,",358.73699999999997,361.967,3.2299999999999613,2782
these species first find it more difficult to make their shells.,362.42,366.88,4.45999999999998,2782
"And at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve.",367.189,370.99800000000005,3.808999999999969,2782
"This here is a pteropod, it's called a sea butterfly.",372.173,375.236,3.062999999999988,2782
"And it's an important food source in the ocean for many species,",375.474,378.648,3.174000000000035,2782
from krill to salmon right up to whales. ,378.91,382.43300000000005,3.522999999999968,2782
The shell of the pteropod was placed into seawater,383.346,386.86,3.5140000000000096,2782
at a pH that we're expecting by the end of this century.,386.885,390.305,3.420000000000016,2782
"After only 45 days at this very realistic pH,",391.162,396.654,5.492000000000019,2782
you can see the shell has almost completely dissolved.,396.99800000000005,401.14,4.141999999999996,2782
So ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain --,401.51300000000003,405.647,4.134000000000015,2782
and right onto our dinner plates. ,405.782,407.893,2.111000000000047,2782
I mean who here likes shellfish? Or salmon?,408.43199999999996,412.074,3.641999999999996,2782
Or many other fish species ,412.64,414.268,1.6280000000000427,2782
whose food source in the ocean could be affected?,414.293,417.13599999999997,2.8430000000000177,2782
These are cold-water corals. ,418.084,419.931,1.84699999999998,2782
"And did you know we actually have cold-water corals in Irish waters,",420.07,423.603,3.5330000000000155,2782
just off our continental shelf? ,423.62800000000004,425.475,1.8470000000000368,2782
"And they support rich biodiversity, including some very important fisheries.",425.981,430.1,4.119000000000028,2782
"It's projected that by the end of this century,",430.814,433.901,3.0869999999999886,2782
70 percent of all known cold-water corals in the entire ocean,434.184,440.148,5.963999999999999,2782
will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure.,440.535,445.22900000000004,4.69399999999996,2782
The last example I have are these healthy tropical corals.,448.80800000000005,452.466,3.658000000000016,2782
They were placed in seawater at a pH we're expecting by the year 2100.,453.03,457.778,4.748000000000047,2782
"After six months, the coral has almost completely dissolved.",459.44199999999995,464.95599999999996,5.514000000000009,2782
Now coral reefs support ,466.12800000000004,468.49300000000005,2.365000000000009,2782
25 percent of all marine life in the entire ocean.,468.564,475.091,6.526999999999987,2782
All marine life. ,475.82800000000003,476.978,1.150000000000034,2782

so close to the train tracks that the merchants ,575.8580000000001,577.8580000000001,2.0,36
sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way. ,577.8580000000001,580.8580000000001,3.0,36

"This here, on the right-hand side, ",607.8580000000001,610.8580000000001,3.0,36
is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- ,610.8580000000001,613.8580000000001,3.0,36
it's a hotel. ,613.8580000000001,615.8580000000001,2.0,36

and wire the neighborhood. ,634.8580000000001,636.8580000000001,2.0,36
"People burn trash to get rid of the garbage, ",636.8580000000001,639.8580000000001,3.0,36

"And when they have more money they cement their streets, ",650.8580000000001,653.8580000000001,3.0,36
"and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that. ",653.8580000000001,657.8580000000001,4.0,36
"This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place, ",657.8580000000001,663.8580000000001,6.0,36

"to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi? ",678.8580000000001,683.8580000000001,5.0,36
I say there are two things. ,683.8580000000001,685.8580000000001,2.0,36
One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted. ,685.8580000000001,687.8580000000001,2.0,36
"That does not necessarily mean property rights, ",687.8580000000001,689.8580000000001,2.0,36
"and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, ",689.8580000000001,693.8580000000001,4.0,36
because property rights create a lot of complications. ,693.8580000000001,695.8580000000001,2.0,36
"They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt ",695.8580000000001,699.8580000000001,4.0,36
"and have to pay back the debt, ",699.8580000000001,701.8580000000001,2.0,36
and sometimes have to sell their property ,701.8580000000001,703.8580000000001,2.0,36
in order to pay back the debt. ,703.8580000000001,705.8580000000001,2.0,36
There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights ,705.8580000000001,707.8580000000001,2.0,36
"sometimes don't work in these cases, ",707.8580000000001,709.8580000000001,2.0,36
but they do need security of tenure. ,709.8580000000001,711.8580000000001,2.0,36
"And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things. ",711.8580000000001,715.8580000000001,4.0,36
"That can mean community organizing from below, ",715.8580000000001,719.8580000000001,4.0,36
but it can also mean possibilities from above. ,719.8580000000001,722.8580000000001,3.0,36
And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable. ,722.8580000000001,727.8580000000001,5.0,36
Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters. ,727.8580000000001,729.8580000000001,2.0,36
"One is that -- it's called ""gecekondu"" in Turkish, ",729.8580000000001,732.8580000000001,3.0,36
"which means ""built overnight,"" and if you build your house overnight ",732.8580000000001,736.8580000000001,4.0,36
"in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law, ",736.8580000000001,740.8580000000001,4.0,36
if they don't catch you during the night. ,740.8580000000001,743.8580000000001,3.0,36
"And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people ",743.8580000000001,747.8580000000001,4.0,36
"in the community, you can petition the government ",747.8580000000001,749.8580000000001,2.0,36

"from what Armstrong said, and from all these people, ",828.8580000000001,830.8580000000001,2.0,36
is that these are neighborhoods. ,830.8580000000001,832.8580000000001,2.0,36

"The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing. ",834.8580000000001,837.8580000000001,3.0,36
The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods -- ,837.8580000000001,840.8580000000001,3.0,36
this is a legitimate form of urban development -- ,840.8580000000001,843.8580000000001,3.0,36

that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids ,66.858,70.858,4.0,4

what we're looking forward to ,114.85799999999999,117.85799999999999,3.0,4
"is not only the inspiration of our children, ",117.85799999999999,120.85799999999999,3.0,4
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing ,120.85799999999999,125.85799999999999,5.0,4
the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's ,125.85799999999999,129.858,4.0,4
space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff. ,129.858,135.858,6.0,4
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later? ,135.858,141.858,6.0,4
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new. ,141.858,147.858,6.0,4
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's -- ,147.858,151.858,4.0,4
"the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, ",151.858,155.858,4.0,4
is that right back to where we inspire people ,155.858,159.858,4.0,4
who will be our great leaders later. ,159.858,161.858,2.0,4
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here. ,161.858,165.858,4.0,4
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young: ,165.858,169.858,4.0,4
"three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds. ",169.858,173.858,4.0,4
What they look at is the most important thing. ,173.858,177.858,4.0,4
Let's take a snapshot at aviation. ,177.858,180.858,3.0,4
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period ,180.858,183.858,3.0,4
when marvelous things happened. ,183.858,186.858,3.0,4
"It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, ",186.858,190.858,4.0,4
"""Ooh, hey, I can do that."" There's only a few people that have flown ",190.858,194.858,4.0,4
"in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, ",194.858,199.858,5.0,4
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. ,199.858,203.858,4.0,4
"Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, ",203.858,207.858,4.0,4
but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. ,207.858,211.858,4.0,4
"There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, ",211.858,216.858,5.0,4
"and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again. ",216.858,220.858,4.0,4
The ones that flew and landed OK ,220.858,223.858,3.0,4
because there were no trained pilots ,223.858,224.858,1.0,4
who had good flying qualities by definition. ,224.858,228.858,4.0,4
"So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, ",228.858,233.858,5.0,4
"in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts ",233.858,236.858,3.0,4
"of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, ",236.858,239.858,3.0,4
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. ,239.858,243.858,4.0,4
That has not happened at all in space flying. ,243.858,245.858,2.0,4
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. ,245.858,249.858,4.0,4
"Well, who was inspired during that time period? ",249.858,251.858,2.0,4
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought ,251.858,254.858,3.0,4
were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation. ,254.858,257.858,3.0,4
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them ,257.858,261.858,4.0,4
was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. ,261.858,268.858,7.0,4
"Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too. ",268.858,272.85799999999995,3.999999999999943,4
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there ,272.85799999999995,277.85799999999995,5.0,4
showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik. ,277.85799999999995,279.85799999999995,2.0,4
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting ,279.85799999999995,283.85799999999995,4.0,4
than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; ,283.85799999999995,285.85799999999995,2.0,4
"we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right? ",285.85799999999995,289.85799999999995,4.0,4
"But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots ",289.85799999999995,292.85799999999995,3.0,4
and they've landed it only in the deserts. ,292.85799999999995,295.85799999999995,3.0,4
(Laughter) ,295.85799999999995,299.85799999999995,4.0,4
"If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew, ",299.85799999999995,306.85799999999995,7.0,4
and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters ,306.85799999999995,309.85799999999995,3.0,4
and the blue line is commercial air transport. ,309.85799999999995,312.85799999999995,3.0,4
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid -- ,312.85799999999995,314.858,2.000000000000057,4
and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage ,314.858,318.858,4.0,4
to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. ,318.858,323.858,5.0,4
"Well, what did I do when I was a kid? ",323.858,325.858,2.0,4
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing ,325.858,328.858,3.0,4
"and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. ",328.858,333.85799999999995,4.999999999999943,4
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War ,333.85799999999995,335.85799999999995,2.0,4
flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force. ,335.85799999999995,338.85799999999995,3.0,4
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes ,338.85799999999995,340.85799999999995,2.0,4
that people could build in their garages. ,340.85799999999995,343.85799999999995,3.0,4
"And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them ",343.85799999999995,346.85799999999995,3.0,4
"is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, ",346.85799999999995,350.85799999999995,4.0,4
which is my company now. ,350.85799999999995,352.85799999999995,2.0,4
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. ,352.85799999999995,359.85799999999995,7.0,4
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. ,359.85799999999995,363.858,4.0,4
"The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed ",363.858,367.858,4.0,4
only a dozen years after the first operational jet. ,367.858,371.858,4.0,4
"Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service. ",371.858,375.858,4.000000000000057,4
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What? ,375.858,382.858,7.0,4
"The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, ",382.858,385.858,3.0,4
"was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, ",385.858,390.858,4.999999999999943,4
"take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- ",390.858,392.858,2.0,4
that's kind of cool. ,392.858,394.858,2.0,4
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72. ,394.858,397.858,3.0,4
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961. ,397.858,402.858,5.0,4
"Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy. ",402.858,407.858,5.0,4
"Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow, ",407.858,412.858,5.0,4
have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else. ,412.858,416.858,4.0,4
These things tend to happen every 25 years. ,416.858,419.858,3.0,4
"40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement ",419.858,423.858,4.0,4
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing -- ,423.858,426.858,3.0,4
"by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel ",426.858,429.858,3.0,4
is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. ,429.858,435.858,6.000000000000057,4
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. ,435.858,443.858,8.0,4
"Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles ",443.858,446.858,3.0,4
if the government develops and the government uses it. ,446.858,449.858,2.999999999999943,4
"You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. ",449.858,453.858,4.0,4
"Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS. ",453.858,456.858,3.0,4
"But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, ",456.858,459.858,3.0,4
all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it. ,459.858,463.858,4.0,4
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation -- ,463.858,466.858,3.0,4
I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none. ,466.858,469.858,3.0,4
"The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, ",469.858,473.858,4.0,4
"and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned ",473.858,476.858,3.0,4
space flights in the world -- the very first year. ,476.858,479.858,3.0,4
"In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed. ",479.858,488.858,9.0,4
There were only three or four flights in 2003. ,488.858,490.858,2.0,4
"In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights ",490.858,497.858,7.000000000000057,4
to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave ,497.858,501.858,4.0,4
with my little group of a couple dozen people ,501.858,503.858,2.0,4
"in order to get to a total of five, ",503.858,505.858,2.0,4
which was the number the same year back in 1961. ,505.858,510.858,4.999999999999943,4
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing. ,510.858,515.8580000000001,5.0,4
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne. ,515.8580000000001,518.8580000000001,3.0,4
This is a picture here taken from orbit. ,518.8580000000001,520.8580000000001,2.0,4
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. ,520.8580000000001,526.8580000000001,6.0,4
"We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough -- ",526.8580000000001,530.8580000000001,4.0,4
at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done. ,530.8580000000001,534.8580000000001,4.0,4
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage ,534.8580000000001,539.8580000000001,5.0,4
to go out and try that as a small company. ,539.8580000000001,546.8580000000001,7.0,4
"Well, first of all, what's going to happen next? ",546.8580000000001,549.8580000000001,3.0,4
"The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players. ",549.8580000000001,553.8580000000001,4.0,4
There's another one announced just last week. ,553.8580000000001,556.8580000000001,3.0,4
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital ,556.8580000000001,562.8580000000001,6.0,4
"is, there is not solutions for adequate safety ",562.8580000000001,565.8580000000001,3.0,4
to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this -- ,565.8580000000001,570.8580000000001,5.0,4
"three governments have been doing this for 45 years, ",570.8580000000001,572.8580000000001,2.0,4
and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. ,572.8580000000001,576.8580000000001,4.0,4
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. ,576.8580000000001,581.8580000000001,5.0,4
"It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. ",581.8580000000001,587.8580000000001,6.0,4
"I can't tell you when this will start, ",587.8580000000001,589.8580000000001,2.0,4
because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. ,589.8580000000001,592.8580000000001,3.0,4
"But I think once it does, we will find solutions, ",592.8580000000001,597.8580000000001,5.0,4
"and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. ",597.8580000000001,600.8580000000001,3.0,4
"And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon ",600.8580000000001,603.8580000000001,3.0,4
so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool. ,603.8580000000001,607.8580000000001,4.0,4
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- ,607.8580000000001,609.8580000000001,2.0,4
you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want. ,609.8580000000001,612.8580000000001,3.0,4
"Oh, it's going to be so much fun. ",612.8580000000001,614.8580000000001,2.0,4
(Laughter) ,614.8580000000001,616.8580000000001,2.0,4
"OK. My critics say, ""Hey, Rutan's just spending ",616.8580000000001,620.8580000000001,4.0,4
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires. ,620.8580000000001,625.8580000000001,5.0,4
"What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."" ",625.8580000000001,630.8580000000001,5.0,4
"And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, ",630.8580000000001,633.8580000000001,3.0,4
"well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 ",633.8580000000001,638.8580000000001,5.0,4
"and I bought it because I could say, ""I got a computer at my house and you don't. ",638.8580000000001,644.8580000000001,6.0,4
"'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger."" OK. ",644.8580000000001,649.8580000000001,5.0,4
(Laughter) ,649.8580000000001,650.8580000000001,1.0,4
"Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, ",650.8580000000001,653.8580000000001,3.0,4
but the home computer was for games. ,653.8580000000001,656.8580000000001,3.0,4
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for. ,656.8580000000001,660.8580000000001,4.0,4
"But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, ",660.8580000000001,664.8580000000001,4.0,4
"big development, big improvement and capability and so on, ",664.8580000000001,668.8580000000001,4.0,4
and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention. ,668.8580000000001,673.8580000000001,5.0,4
And the inventor is in this audience. ,673.8580000000001,675.8580000000001,2.0,4
"Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, ",675.8580000000001,679.8580000000001,4.0,4
something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- ,679.8580000000001,682.8580000000001,3.0,4
"a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research, ",682.8580000000001,688.8580000000001,6.0,4
"our communication and, if we let the Google guys ",688.8580000000001,692.8580000000001,4.0,4
"think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter) ",692.8580000000001,696.8580000000001,4.0,4
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids ,696.8580000000001,699.8580000000001,3.0,4
that we didn't always have computers in our homes. ,699.8580000000001,704.8580000000001,5.0,4
So fun is defendable. ,704.8580000000001,707.8580000000001,3.0,4
"OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, ",707.8580000000001,712.8580000000001,5.0,4
but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen. ,712.8580000000001,715.8580000000001,3.0,4
"And in it also brings up another point, right here. ",715.8580000000001,719.8580000000001,4.0,4
There's a group of people that have come forward -- ,719.8580000000001,723.8580000000001,4.0,4
and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward ,723.8580000000001,726.8580000000001,3.0,4
"were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, ",726.8580000000001,733.8580000000001,7.0,4
"by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, ",733.8580000000001,736.8580000000001,3.0,4
right in this time period. ,736.8580000000001,738.8580000000001,2.0,4
"Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, ",738.8580000000001,748.8580000000001,10.0,4
"which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, ",748.8580000000001,753.8580000000001,5.0,4
"Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. ",753.8580000000001,757.8580000000001,4.0,4
"These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, ",757.8580000000001,763.8580000000001,6.0,4
and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area ,763.8580000000001,766.8580000000001,3.0,4
of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- ,766.8580000000001,770.8580000000001,4.0,4
"areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, ",770.8580000000001,774.8580000000001,4.0,4
and it will lead us into the next really big thing ,774.8580000000001,776.8580000000001,2.0,4
and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually ,776.8580000000001,780.8580000000001,4.0,4
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. ,780.8580000000001,784.8580000000001,4.0,4
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. ,784.8580000000001,790.8580000000001,6.0,4
There were a couple of examples here. ,790.8580000000001,792.8580000000001,2.0,4
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane ,792.8580000000001,796.8580000000001,4.0,4
"was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, ",796.8580000000001,801.8580000000001,5.0,4
and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. ,801.8580000000001,806.8580000000001,5.0,4
"It went a whole life cycle without competition, ",806.8580000000001,809.8580000000001,3.0,4
took out of service. And we're stuck back here ,809.8580000000001,812.8580000000001,3.0,4
with the same kind of capability for military fighters ,812.8580000000001,815.8580000000001,3.0,4
and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s. ,815.8580000000001,819.8580000000001,4.0,4
But something is out there to inspire our kids now. ,819.8580000000001,823.8580000000001,4.0,4
"And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, ",823.8580000000001,825.8580000000001,2.0,4
or if you've got a 10-year-old now. ,825.8580000000001,826.8580000000001,1.0,4
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. ,826.8580000000001,832.8580000000001,6.0,4
"Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket ",832.8580000000001,834.8580000000001,2.0,4
and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance ,834.8580000000001,839.8580000000001,5.0,4
military operational airplane. It's never happened before. ,839.8580000000001,843.8580000000001,4.0,4

"Is it legal, or is it illegal? ",227.00400000000002,229.303,2.2990000000000066,45969
But the people who are wrestling with these questions,229.692,232.195,2.502999999999986,45969
and making these decisions about their families,232.21900000000002,236.03400000000002,3.8149999999999977,45969
are thinking about very different questions:,236.058,238.622,2.5640000000000214,45969
How do I keep my daughter safe? ,238.646,240.519,1.8729999999999905,45969
How do I protect my son? ,241.416,242.858,1.4420000000000073,45969
"And if you want absolutes, ",244.072,246.332,2.259999999999991,45969
it's absolutely legal to seek asylum. ,246.356,249.36900000000003,3.013000000000005,45969
It is a fundamental right in our own laws and in international law.,249.82,254.707,4.8870000000000005,45969
"And, in fact -- ",254.731,255.921,1.1899999999999975,45969
(Applause) ,255.945,262.809,6.864000000000032,45969
"it stems from the 1951 Refugee Convention, ",262.833,266.374,3.5410000000000537,45969
which was the world's response to the Holocaust,266.39799999999997,269.47,3.0720000000000027,45969
and a way for countries to say never again would we return people to countries,269.494,273.30400000000003,3.8099999999999454,45969
where they would harmed or killed. ,273.328,275.532,2.204000000000008,45969
There are several ways refugees come to this country.,276.264,278.785,2.520999999999958,45969
One is through the US Refugee Admissions Program.,278.809,281.613,2.8040000000000305,45969
"Through that program, the US identifies and selects refugees abroad",281.637,285.767,4.129999999999996,45969
and brings them to the United States. ,285.791,287.847,2.055999999999983,45969
"Last year, the US resettled fewer refugees ",288.485,292.127,3.641999999999996,45969
than at any time since the program began in 1980.,292.151,295.832,3.6809999999999827,45969
"And this year, it'll probably be less. ",295.856,297.814,1.9580000000000268,45969
And this is at a time when we have more refugees in the world,298.758,301.721,2.9630000000000223,45969
"than at any other time in recorded history,",301.745,303.8,2.055000000000007,45969
even since World War II. ,303.824,305.21299999999997,1.3890000000000102,45969
Another way that refugees come to this country is by seeking asylum.,305.978,309.745,3.766999999999996,45969
Asylum seekers are people who present themselves at a border,309.769,313.05400000000003,3.2849999999999686,45969
and say that they'll be persecuted if they're sent back home.,313.078,316.382,3.3040000000000305,45969
An asylum seeker is simply somebody who's going through the process,316.406,319.62,3.213999999999998,45969
in the United States ,319.644,320.803,1.1589999999999918,45969
to prove that they meet the refugee definition.,320.827,323.365,2.538000000000011,45969
And it's never been more difficult to seek asylum.,325.365,328.801,3.435999999999978,45969
Border guards are telling people when they show up at our borders,328.825,331.903,3.078000000000032,45969
"that our country's full, that they simply can't apply.",331.92699999999996,334.476,2.5489999999999777,45969
This is unprecedented and illegal. ,334.5,336.311,1.8109999999999784,45969
"Under a new program, ",336.786,339.026,2.240000000000009,45969
"with the kind of Orwellian title ""Migrant Protection Protocols,""",339.05,343.216,4.165999999999997,45969
refugees are told they have to wait in Mexico,344.43,347.086,2.656000000000006,45969
"while their cases make their way through the courts in the United States,",347.11,350.588,3.4780000000000086,45969
and this can take months or years. ,350.61199999999997,352.2680000000001,1.656000000000006,45969
"Meanwhile, they're not safe, ",352.2920000000001,354.111,1.81899999999996,45969
and they have no access to lawyers. ,354.135,356.158,2.023000000000025,45969
"Our country, our government, has detained over 3,000 children,",357.788,362.148,4.360000000000014,45969
"separating them from their parents' arms, ",362.17199999999997,364.749,2.5769999999999977,45969
as a deterrent from seeking asylum. ,364.773,366.85900000000004,2.0859999999999563,45969
"Many were toddlers, ",367.681,369.09,1.4089999999999918,45969
and at least one was a six-year-old blind girl.,369.871,372.515,2.644000000000005,45969
And this is still going on. ,372.539,374.02,1.4809999999999943,45969
We spend billions to detain people in what are virtually prisons,374.77,378.63800000000003,3.8679999999999954,45969
who have committed no crime. ,378.662,380.199,1.5370000000000346,45969
And family separation has become the hallmark of our immigration system.,382.75699999999995,388.18800000000005,5.430999999999983,45969
That's a far cry from a shining city on a hill or a beacon of hope,388.561,393.619,5.0580000000000505,45969
or all of the other ways we like to talk about ourselves and our values.,393.643,397.482,3.8389999999999422,45969
"Migration has always been with us, and it always will be.",398.095,401.343,3.2479999999999905,45969
"The reasons why people flee -- persecution, war, violence,",401.857,405.536,3.6790000000000314,45969
climate change ,405.56,407.07300000000004,1.5129999999999768,45969

those pressures are only growing. ,411.411,413.227,1.815999999999974,45969
But there are ways that we can have policies that reflect our values,414.56,420.23699999999997,5.677000000000022,45969
"and actually make sense, given the reality in the world.",420.26099999999997,423.176,2.914999999999964,45969
The first thing we need to do is dial back the toxic rhetoric,423.93800000000005,430.02099999999996,6.083000000000028,45969
that has been the basis of our national debate on this issue for too long.,430.045,434.736,4.690999999999974,45969

Global cooperation as a response to global migration and displacement,473.699,478.75300000000004,5.053999999999974,45969
would go a long way towards making migration something that isn't a crisis,478.777,483.26199999999994,4.485000000000014,45969
"but something that just is, ",483.286,484.639,1.3530000000000086,45969
and that we deal with as a global community.,484.663,487.211,2.5480000000000023,45969
Humanitarian aid is also critical. ,488.44599999999997,490.851,2.4049999999999727,45969
The amount of support we provide to countries in Central America,490.875,493.876,3.0009999999999764,45969
that are sending refugees and migrants ,493.9,496.329,2.4290000000000305,45969
is a tiny fraction of the amount we spend on enforcement and detention.,496.353,501.548,5.194999999999993,45969
And we can absolutely have an asylum system that works.,502.714,506.483,3.7690000000000055,45969
"For a tiny fraction of the cost of a wall, ",507.418,510.13800000000003,2.7199999999999704,45969

"""We came in peace for all mankind."" ",50.708,52.391999999999996,1.6840000000000046,45970

but it's also set in a typeface that's perfect for this moment.,55.541000000000004,59.391999999999996,3.8510000000000066,45970
"It seems industrial, it seems engineered. ",59.416000000000004,62.601000000000006,3.1850000000000023,45970
It also is the best possible name ,62.625,64.197,1.5720000000000027,45970
you could come up with for something on the moon: Futura.,64.221,68.017,3.795999999999992,45970
"Now, I want to talk to you about fonts, ",68.041,69.899,1.858000000000004,45970
and why this typeface is perfect for this moment.,69.923,72.267,2.343999999999994,45970
But it's actually more than just ceremonial.,72.291,74.375,2.084000000000003,45970
"Now, when all of you arrived here today, ",75.208,77.976,2.7680000000000007,45970
you actually had to think about fonts. ,78.0,80.601,2.600999999999999,45970
"You might not realize it, ",80.625,81.892,1.266999999999996,45970
but you're all unconscious experts on typography.,81.916,84.89200000000001,2.9759999999999986,45970
"Typography is the study of how fonts inhabit our world,",84.916,89.26700000000001,4.350999999999999,45970

"Here's the thing that's funny about this, though.",93.958,96.26700000000001,2.308999999999997,45970

trying to get ones with the right features.,109.0,111.059,2.058999999999997,45970
"But all of you actually spend hours every day, evaluating fonts.",111.083,114.226,3.1430000000000007,45970
"If you don't believe me, think about how you got here.",114.25,116.809,2.558999999999997,45970
Each of you had to judge by the signs ,116.833,118.601,1.768000000000001,45970
"and maybe even on your phone, ",118.625,120.059,1.4339999999999975,45970
which signals to trust and which to ignore.,120.083,123.559,3.4759999999999986,45970
You were evaluating fonts. ,123.583,124.851,1.268000000000001,45970
"Or maybe when you're just buying a new product,",124.875,127.101,2.225999999999999,45970
you have to think about whether something is expensive,127.125,129.649,2.524000000000001,45970
or cheap or hard to get or easy to find. ,129.673,133.392,3.7189999999999936,45970
"And the funny thing about it is, ",133.416,135.017,1.600999999999999,45970
"this may not seem extraordinary to you, ",135.041,136.899,1.858000000000004,45970
"but the moment you see something out of place,",136.923,139.226,2.3029999999999973,45970
you recognize it right away. ,139.25,140.601,1.350999999999999,45970
(Laughter) ,140.625,143.017,2.391999999999996,45970
"The thing I love about typography, ",143.041,144.726,1.6850000000000025,45970
"and why I love fonts and why I love Futura,",144.75,147.017,2.266999999999996,45970
"is that, for me, what I study is everywhere.",147.041,150.892,3.8509999999999986,45970
"Every street that I walk down, every book that I pick up,",150.916,153.601,2.6850000000000023,45970
every thing that I read is filled with the thing I love.,153.625,158.767,5.141999999999996,45970
"Now, once you understand the history and what happens with typography,",158.791,163.101,4.310000000000001,45970
you actually have a history of everything before you.,163.125,166.517,3.391999999999996,45970
And this is the typeface Futura. ,166.541,168.767,2.225999999999999,45970
"As previously we've discussed, this is modernism in miniature.",168.791,172.18400000000003,3.3930000000000007,45970
This is a way in which modernism infiltrated this country,172.208,174.976,2.7680000000000007,45970
"and became perhaps the most popular, or promiscuous typeface,",175.0,178.226,3.2259999999999986,45970
of the twentieth century. ,178.25,180.226,1.975999999999999,45970
"""Less is more,"" right, these are the aphorisms of modernism.",180.25,183.55900000000003,3.308999999999997,45970
"And in the visual arts, the same thing happened.",183.583,185.851,2.2680000000000007,45970
"Let's focus on the essentials, focus on the basic shapes,",185.875,188.55900000000003,2.683999999999997,45970
focus on geometry. ,188.583,189.851,1.268000000000001,45970
So Futura actually holds this to its core. ,189.875,192.601,2.7259999999999986,45970
You might notice that the shapes inherent in Futura,192.625,195.05900000000003,2.433999999999997,45970
"have circles, squares, triangles. ",195.083,196.80900000000003,1.725999999999999,45970
"Some of the shapes are all based on circles,",196.833,198.93400000000003,2.100999999999999,45970
"like the O, D and C, ",198.958,200.226,1.268000000000001,45970
or others have this pointed apex of the triangle.,200.25,203.726,3.4759999999999986,45970
Others just look like they might have been made,203.75,205.976,2.225999999999999,45970
with a ruler or a compass. ,206.0,207.30900000000003,1.3089999999999975,45970
"They feel geometric, they feel mathematic, precise.",207.333,210.017,2.683999999999997,45970
"In fact, this whole system carries through with the way",210.041,212.642,2.600999999999999,45970
that the typeface was designed. ,212.666,214.18400000000003,1.518000000000001,45970
"To not look like it was made like other typefaces, to be something new.",214.208,217.55900000000003,3.3509999999999986,45970
"Here it is in the lightweight, the medium weight and the bold weight.",217.583,221.80900000000003,4.225999999999999,45970
The whole family has different things to commend to it.,221.833,224.80900000000003,2.9759999999999986,45970
"This was a conscious break from the past, ",224.833,226.80900000000003,1.975999999999999,45970
"something that looked like it was made by a machine, and not by hand.",226.833,230.101,3.2680000000000007,45970
"When I say not made by hand, this is what I mean.",230.125,232.43400000000003,2.308999999999997,45970
"This is what we think about maybe, ",232.458,234.101,1.643000000000001,45970
when you might create something with a calligraphic brush or a pen.,234.125,237.726,3.6009999999999986,45970
That there's thicks and thins. ,237.75,239.18400000000003,1.4339999999999975,45970
"And even more traditional typefaces, say like a Garamond,",239.208,242.601,3.3930000000000007,45970
holds vestiges of this old system ,242.625,244.392,1.766999999999996,45970
in which you can see the A where it get little bit thinner at the top,244.416,247.68400000000003,3.2680000000000007,45970
"and thicker down below, ",247.708,248.976,1.268000000000001,45970
because it's trying to look like someone had made it by hand.,249.0,251.892,2.891999999999996,45970
"But Futura, in contrast, ",251.916,253.226,1.3100000000000025,45970
"is designed to look like no one had touched it at all,",253.25,255.80900000000003,2.558999999999997,45970
"that this was made by a machine, ",255.833,257.392,1.5589999999999975,45970
"for a machine age, for an industrial age. ",257.416,259.392,1.975999999999999,45970
There's actually a sleight of hand here ,259.416,261.476,2.0600000000000023,45970
"that Paul Renner, the designer who made this in 1927, employed.",261.5,265.226,3.7259999999999986,45970
If you look at the way in which ,265.25,266.767,1.516999999999996,45970
"the circular shape joins with the vertical shaft,",266.791,269.725,2.9340000000000264,45970
you'll notice that it tapers just every so slightly.,269.749,272.975,3.2259999999999986,45970
And this is one of hundreds of ways ,272.999,274.726,1.7269999999999754,45970
"in which this typeface was designed to look geometrically perfect,",274.75,277.892,3.141999999999996,45970
even though it's mathematically not. ,277.916,279.684,1.7679999999999725,45970
And this is what typeface designers do all the time,279.708,282.101,2.393000000000029,45970
"to make typefaces work, every day. ",282.125,284.767,2.641999999999996,45970
"Now, there were other designers doing this at the same time in Europe and America.",284.791,288.684,3.892999999999972,45970
"These are a few other excellent examples from Europe,",288.708,291.226,2.518000000000029,45970
"trying to create something new for the new age, a new moment in time.",291.25,294.517,3.266999999999996,45970
These are some other ones in Germany ,294.541,296.309,1.7679999999999725,45970
"that in some ways look very similar to Futura,",296.333,298.517,2.184000000000026,45970
maybe with higher waist or lower waist or different proportions.,298.541,301.601,3.0600000000000023,45970
Then why did Futura take over the world? ,301.625,303.559,1.934000000000026,45970
"In this case, if you can read the titles there,",303.58299999999997,306.101,2.5179999999999723,45970
some of these names don't quite roll off the tongue:,306.125,308.892,2.766999999999996,45970
"Erbar, Kabel Light, Berthold-Grotesk, Elegant-Grotesk.",308.916,314.267,5.350999999999999,45970
"These aren't exactly household names, are they?",314.291,316.517,2.225999999999999,45970
"And so when you compare that to Futura, ",316.541,319.226,2.6850000000000023,45970
you realize that this was a really good choice by the marketing team.,319.25,322.517,3.266999999999996,45970
What's amazing about this name -- ,322.541,324.267,1.725999999999999,45970
"you know, what's in this name is that this is a name",324.291,326.934,2.643000000000029,45970
that actually invokes hope and an idea about the future.,326.958,330.642,3.6840000000000264,45970
"And this isn't actually the word for future in German,",330.666,333.19,2.524000000000001,45970
"it wasn't a German name, ",333.214,334.476,1.2620000000000005,45970
they actually picked something ,334.5,335.976,1.475999999999999,45970
"that would speak to a wider, larger audience, a universal audience.",336.0,339.184,3.183999999999969,45970
And when you compare it to what was being done in America --,339.208,342.059,2.8509999999999986,45970
these are the typefaces from the same period,342.083,344.184,2.100999999999999,45970
"in the United States in the 1920s, ",344.208,345.851,1.6430000000000289,45970
"bold, brash, braggadocios. ",345.875,347.184,1.308999999999969,45970
You almost think of this as exactly like what the stock market looked like,347.208,350.726,3.5180000000000287,45970
when they were all going nuts in the 1920s.,350.75,352.809,2.058999999999969,45970
And you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary.,352.833,355.726,2.8930000000000287,45970
I want to step back and talk about an example of the typeface in use.,355.75,359.934,4.183999999999969,45970
"So this is a magazine that we all probably know today, ""Vanity Fair.""",359.958,363.226,3.2680000000000287,45970
"This is what it looked like in 1929, in the summer.",363.25,366.601,3.3509999999999986,45970
"And in many ways, there's nothing wrong with this design.",366.625,370.017,3.391999999999996,45970
This is absolutely typical of the 1920s. ,370.041,372.642,2.600999999999999,45970
"There's a photograph of an important person,",372.666,374.767,2.100999999999999,45970
"in this case Franklin Roosevelt, then-governor of New York.",374.791,377.601,2.8100000000000023,45970
"Everything seems centered, everything seems symmetrical.",377.625,380.267,2.641999999999996,45970
"There's still a little bit of ornamentation,",380.291,382.392,2.100999999999999,45970
so this is still maybe having some vestiges of the painted lady,382.416,385.392,2.9759999999999986,45970
and not fully modernistic. ,385.416,386.684,1.268000000000029,45970
But everything seems kid of solid. ,386.708,388.351,1.6430000000000289,45970
There's even drop caps to help you get into the text.,388.375,390.892,2.516999999999996,45970
"But this all changed very quickly and in October of 1929,",390.916,393.642,2.7259999999999986,45970
"a Berlin-based designer came and redesigned ""Vanity Fair.""",393.666,396.642,2.9759999999999986,45970
And this is what it looks like with Futura.,396.666,399.851,3.1850000000000023,45970
Instead of the governor ,399.875,401.726,1.850999999999999,45970
"now we have a photograph of an abstract, beautiful setting,",401.75,404.642,2.891999999999996,45970
"in this case, the ocean. ",404.666,406.184,1.5179999999999725,45970
"Instead of drop caps, there's nothing at all.",406.208,408.434,2.225999999999999,45970
And replaced with a centered layout is now asymmetry.,408.458,412.517,4.059000000000026,45970
And it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine.,412.541,415.601,3.0600000000000023,45970
"In this case, even more dramatic asymmetry.",415.625,417.642,2.016999999999996,45970
"In this case, illustrations by Pablo Picasso, moving across the page",417.666,420.934,3.2680000000000287,45970
and breaking the gutter of the two pages. ,420.958,424.851,3.892999999999972,45970
And there's something even more radical. ,424.875,426.809,1.934000000000026,45970
"If you look closely at the Futura, you might notice something.",426.833,429.767,2.933999999999969,45970
"You might not pick it up at first, ",429.791,431.434,1.6430000000000289,45970
but there are no capital letters in the title or the captions on this page.,431.458,435.017,3.558999999999969,45970
"You might not think that's very radical, ",435.041,436.976,1.9350000000000025,45970
"but pick up any magazine, any book or go to any website,",437.0,439.642,2.641999999999996,45970
"and I guarantee, you are not going to find it very easily.",439.666,442.434,2.768000000000029,45970
This is still a radical idea. ,442.458,444.851,2.393000000000029,45970
And why is that radical? ,444.875,446.142,1.266999999999996,45970
"When we think about what capital letters denote,",446.166,449.142,2.9759999999999986,45970
"they denote something important, ",449.166,450.976,1.8100000000000025,45970
"whether it's our names, or our titles. ",451.0,453.142,2.141999999999996,45970
"Or maybe even just the name of our corporations,",453.166,456.101,2.9350000000000023,45970
or maybe our trademarks. ,456.125,457.851,1.725999999999999,45970
"Actually, in some ways, America's the home of capitalization.",457.875,461.309,3.433999999999969,45970
We love putting capitals in everything. ,461.333,463.226,1.8930000000000289,45970
(Laughter) ,463.25,464.892,1.641999999999996,45970
But think about how radical this would be ,464.916,466.892,1.975999999999999,45970
to introduce a magazine where you're taking away all the capital letters.,466.916,471.226,4.310000000000001,45970
This has maybe had the same political force,471.25,473.309,2.058999999999969,45970
that we now argue over things like pronouns in our society today.,473.333,477.059,3.7259999999999986,45970
"In the 1920s, ",477.083,478.642,1.559000000000026,45970
this is just shortly after Soviet Russia had a communist revolution.,478.666,483.291,4.625,45970
"And for them, this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America.",484.208,488.851,4.642999999999971,45970
"All lowercase letters meant that this was an egalitarian,",488.875,492.726,3.8509999999999986,45970
complete lowering of everything into one equal playing field.,492.75,496.767,4.016999999999996,45970
Now this is still kind of a radical idea. ,496.791,498.767,1.975999999999999,45970
Think about how often you do capitalize something,498.791,501.077,2.2860000000000014,45970
to have more power or prestige to it. ,501.101,502.892,1.7909999999999968,45970
So for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea.,502.916,507.101,4.185000000000001,45970
"Now, other designers were doing other things with Futura.",507.125,510.309,3.1840000000000264,45970
"Others brought other ideas of modernism with it,",510.333,512.601,2.268000000000029,45970
"whether it was interesting new illustration styles,",512.625,515.0169999999999,2.3920000000000528,45970
or interesting new collage types of illustration.,515.0409999999998,517.8919999999999,2.8510000000001128,45970
"Or even just new book covers, ",517.9159999999998,519.976,2.060000000000059,45970
whether they were from Europe. ,520.0,522.101,2.100999999999999,45970
But here's the funny thing. ,522.125,523.976,1.850999999999999,45970
"In the 1920s, if you wanted to use a new typeface,",524.0,526.351,2.350999999999999,45970
you couldn't just go download it onto your computer.,526.375,528.809,2.4339999999999695,45970
You actually had to have pieces of lead. ,528.8330000000001,531.016,2.1829999999999927,45970
So for Americans who wanted to adopt this ,531.04,533.101,2.0610000000000355,45970
"and make it part of their own system, ",533.125,535.141,2.0159999999999627,45970
"something they could use in everyday typography,",535.165,538.0169999999999,2.8520000000000887,45970
"whether in ads or anything else, ",538.0409999999998,539.684,1.6430000000000289,45970
they actually had to have metal type. ,539.7080000000001,541.8919999999999,2.1840000000000828,45970
"So being good American capitalists, what did we do?",541.9159999999999,544.351,2.434999999999945,45970
We made all sorts of copies. ,544.375,545.7669999999999,1.3920000000000528,45970
"Ones that had nothing to do with the name Futura,",545.7909999999999,548.101,2.309999999999945,45970
"but looked identical to it, ",548.125,549.976,1.850999999999999,45970
whether it was Spartan or Tempo. ,550.0,551.559,1.558999999999969,45970
"And in fact, by the time that World War II started,",551.5830000000001,554.309,2.7259999999999986,45970
American corporations were actually trying to boycott Nazi goods.,554.3330000000001,557.7669999999999,3.4340000000000828,45970
"But they said, ""Go ahead and use our copies.",557.7909999999999,560.2669999999999,2.475999999999999,45970
"Use 20th Century, use Spartan, use Vogue, use Tempo.",560.2909999999999,562.976,2.684999999999945,45970
"These are identical to Futura."" ",563.0,565.309,2.3089999999999695,45970
"And in fact, for most people, they didn't even learn the new names,",565.3330000000001,568.5169999999999,3.1840000000000828,45970
they just still called it all Futura. ,568.5409999999999,570.309,1.7679999999999154,45970
"So America took this typeface in, ",570.3330000000001,572.8919999999999,2.5590000000000828,45970
conquered it and made it its own. ,572.9159999999998,574.8919999999999,1.9760000000001128,45970
"So by the time World War II finishes, ",574.9159999999998,577.809,2.8930000000000287,45970
"Americans are using this on everything, ",577.8330000000001,579.691,1.8580000000000612,45970
"whether it be catalogs, or atlases, ",579.715,581.934,2.218999999999937,45970
"or encyclopedias or charts and graphs, ",581.9580000000001,585.2669999999999,3.3090000000000828,45970
"or calendars, or even political material. ",585.2909999999998,588.934,3.6430000000000287,45970

"And in fact, it was used even on some of the most important advertising",593.0,596.3919999999999,3.3920000000000528,45970
of the 20th century. ,596.4159999999998,597.726,1.3100000000000591,45970
So it's in this context ,597.75,599.059,1.308999999999969,45970
that when the US government was picking a typeface,599.0830000000001,601.434,2.350999999999999,45970
"to use after World War II for new maps and new projects,",601.4580000000001,604.078,2.6200000000000045,45970
they picked Futura. ,604.102,605.351,1.2490000000000236,45970
"It wasn't an astounding choice, it wasn't a radical choice,",605.375,608.184,2.808999999999969,45970
it didn't have anything to do with communism.,608.2080000000001,610.351,2.143000000000029,45970
"But in this case, it was used on some of the most important maps,",610.375,613.476,3.1009999999999986,45970
"so this one, an air force map in 1962, ",613.5,615.351,1.850999999999999,45970
or used for the maps in Vietnam in '66. ,615.375,617.7909999999999,2.4160000000000537,45970
And so it wasn't a surprise ,618.7909999999999,620.101,1.3099999999999454,45970
"that when astronauts first started the Mercury program,",620.125,623.184,3.058999999999969,45970
"such as John Glenn orbiting the earth, ",623.2080000000001,625.018,1.8100000000000591,45970
that charts and maps that he was using were in Futura.,625.0419999999999,627.6419999999999,2.6000000000000227,45970
"And in fact, by the time Mercury morphed into Apollo,",627.6659999999999,631.684,4.0179999999999145,45970
it started getting used more and more for more things.,631.7080000000001,634.309,2.600999999999999,45970
"So in this case for a safety plan, ",634.3330000000001,636.976,2.643000000000029,45970
"or even starting to get used on instrument panels,",637.0,639.601,2.600999999999999,45970
or navigational aids. ,639.625,641.309,1.683999999999969,45970
Or even on diagrams to show how the whole system worked.,641.3330000000001,644.476,3.1430000000000287,45970
"But here's the amazing thing, ",644.5,645.8919999999999,1.3920000000000528,45970
it didn't just get used for papers that they handed out to people.,645.9159999999998,649.0169999999999,3.1010000000001128,45970
"It started to get used for an interface, ",649.0409999999998,650.976,1.9350000000000591,45970
for an entire system that helped the astronauts,651.0,653.226,2.225999999999999,45970
know how to use the machine. ,653.25,654.7669999999999,1.5170000000000528,45970
NASA wasn't just one big corporation making everything.,654.7909999999998,658.6419999999999,3.8510000000001128,45970
There was hundreds of contractors -- ,658.6659999999998,660.5169999999999,1.8510000000001128,45970
"Boeing, IBM, McDonnell Douglas -- ",660.541,662.934,2.3929999999999154,45970
all making different machines. ,662.9580000000001,664.3919999999999,1.4340000000000828,45970
Now imagine if astronauts had to use different typefaces and different systems,664.416,668.1010000000001,3.6849999999999454,45970
for each component they had in the space shuttles.,668.125,671.5169999999999,3.3920000000000528,45970
This would have been impossible to navigate,671.541,673.559,2.0179999999999154,45970
and there would have been a cognitive overload,673.5830000000001,675.7260000000001,2.143000000000029,45970
every time they had to open up a new system.,675.75,677.8510000000001,2.100999999999999,45970
"So in this case, Futura being used on the interface",677.875,680.5169999999999,2.6420000000000528,45970
helped them navigate complexity and make it more clear.,680.541,684.0169999999999,3.4759999999999986,45970
"And it wasn't just used on buttons, it was used on labels,",684.041,687.184,3.1429999999999154,45970
"and it was used on their food rations, ",687.2080000000001,689.018,1.8100000000000591,45970
and it was used on their tool kits. ,689.0419999999999,691.2260000000001,2.183999999999969,45970
It was used on knobs and levers to tell them what to do.,691.25,695.309,4.058999999999969,45970
"In fact, maybe even some of the places ",695.3330000000001,697.184,1.850999999999999,45970
"where they needed to have things that were complex be more simple to them,",697.2080000000001,700.685,3.4769999999999754,45970

so that they could know what to do with that one moment.,703.2909999999998,705.934,2.643000000000029,45970
"They didn't have to remember everything in their head,",705.9580000000001,708.5169999999999,2.5590000000000828,45970
they could have it out there in the world to see and refer to.,708.5409999999998,711.4760000000001,2.9350000000000582,45970

"which was already a very difficult and complex system,",713.6659999999998,716.9760000000001,3.3100000000000582,45970
a little less complex. ,717.0,718.375,1.375,45970
"In fact, the very first or last thing an astronaut might have seen",719.0409999999998,722.184,3.1430000000000287,45970

would have been in Futura. ,724.541,725.809,1.2679999999999154,45970
One of my favorite examples of how Futura worked in this way,725.8330000000001,728.9760000000001,3.1430000000000287,45970
is actually this camera. ,729.0,730.309,1.308999999999969,45970
This is a Hasselblad that was made by the Swedish company.,730.3330000000001,734.559,4.225999999999999,45970
"It's a perfectly good camera, some of you might have used one,",734.5830000000001,737.5169999999999,2.9340000000000828,45970
it's prized by photographers as a really great camera.,737.541,741.3919999999999,3.8509999999999986,45970
"And you might notice, if you know anything about cameras,",741.416,744.1010000000001,2.684999999999945,45970
that there's some modifications made to it.,744.125,746.184,2.058999999999969,45970
"In this case, there are stickers placed all over the film canisters,",746.2080000000001,749.434,3.2259999999999986,45970
or other parts of the camera here. ,749.4580000000001,752.184,2.7259999999999986,45970
"What this enabled NASA to do, ",752.2080000000001,754.2669999999999,2.0590000000000828,45970
was make something really great out of the astronauts.,754.2909999999998,757.7669999999999,3.4760000000001128,45970

because of the labels placed there in Futura.,763.6659999999998,765.8510000000001,2.185000000000059,45970
"So in this case, ",765.875,767.1419999999999,1.2670000000000528,45970
Futura acquired and made sure that they had legitimacy,767.1659999999998,770.9760000000001,3.8100000000000582,45970

"but if you can't get a child there or if a parent won't send a child there,",382.827,387.83099999999996,5.004000000000018,45972
"isn't a technology-delivered, results-based option a great alternative?",387.855,393.954,6.0989999999999895,45972
And we love working with site-based preschools.,393.978,397.006,3.027999999999963,45972
"Right now, there are 800 children in Mississippi",397.03,400.006,2.9759999999999986,45972
going to Head Start during the day ,400.03,402.3,2.2700000000000387,45972
and doing UPSTART at night with their families.,402.324,405.537,3.212999999999965,45972
Our audacious idea is to take UPSTART across the country --,407.32,411.466,4.146000000000015,45972
not to replace anything; ,412.205,415.412,3.2069999999999936,45972
we want to serve children who otherwise would not have access to early education.,415.436,420.718,5.282000000000039,45972
"We have the guts to take on the skeptics, ",421.898,424.376,2.477999999999952,45972
"we have the energy to do the work, ",424.4,426.315,1.9150000000000205,45972
and we have a plan. ,426.339,427.874,1.535000000000025,45972
It is the role of the states to educate their children.,428.482,432.37300000000005,3.89100000000002,45972
So first we will use philanthropy dollars ,432.397,435.037,2.6399999999999864,45972
to go into a state to pilot the program and get data.,435.061,438.846,3.785000000000025,45972
Every state believes it's unique ,439.409,442.035,2.626000000000033,45972
and wants to know that the program will work with its children,442.059,446.083,4.023999999999944,45972
before investing. ,446.107,447.30199999999996,1.19500000000005,45972
Then we identify key leaders in the state to help us champion UPSTART,447.832,452.689,4.857000000000029,45972
as an option for unserved children. ,452.713,455.69199999999995,2.978999999999985,45972
"And together, we go to state legislatures ",455.716,459.147,3.4309999999999827,45972
to transition UPSTART from philanthropy ,459.171,461.651,2.480000000000018,45972
to sustainable and scalable state funding. ,461.675,464.795,3.1200000000000045,45972
That plan has worked -- ,465.441,467.024,1.58299999999997,45972
(Applause) ,467.048,469.27,2.22199999999998,45972

Thank you. ,473.315,474.5,1.1850000000000025,45972
That plan has worked in three states to date:,474.524,478.13199999999995,3.608000000000004,45972
"Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. ",478.156,480.996,2.839999999999975,45972
We've also piloted the program in a number of states,481.02,484.07300000000004,3.0529999999999973,45972
and identified champions. ,484.097,486.25,2.15300000000002,45972
"Next, we're moving to states with the greatest geographic barriers",486.274,490.043,3.7690000000000055,45972

and then on to states that already have early education,491.532,494.89,3.358000000000004,45972
but may not be getting great academic results,494.914,497.686,2.771999999999992,45972
or great parent buy-in to participate. ,497.71,500.564,2.854000000000042,45972
"From there, we go to the states ",500.588,502.346,1.7579999999999814,45972

and we'll hope our momentum helps turn the tide there.,507.532,510.975,3.4430000000000405,45972
"We will serve a quarter of a million children in five years,",510.999,514.082,3.08299999999997,45972
and we will ensure that states continue to offer UPSTART to their children.,514.106,518.987,4.880999999999972,45972
Here's how you can help: ,520.309,521.9540000000001,1.6449999999999818,45972
"for two thousand dollars, ",522.5319999999999,523.863,1.3310000000000173,45972
"we can provide a child with UPSTART, a computer and internet,",523.887,527.768,3.8810000000000855,45972
and that child will be part of the pilot ,527.7919999999999,530.571,2.7789999999999964,45972
that makes certain other children get UPSTART in the future.,530.595,533.938,3.3429999999999613,45972
We also need engaged citizens to go to their government,534.479,537.46,2.9809999999999945,45972
and say just how easy it can be to get children ready for school.,537.484,543.2819999999999,5.798000000000003,45972
"You wouldn't be here if you weren't an engaged citizen,",543.625,546.877,3.2519999999999527,45972
so we're asking for your help. ,546.901,548.827,1.9260000000000448,45972
"Now, will all of us this make UPSTART a watershed moment in early education?",550.4540000000001,556.082,5.628000000000043,45972
I believe together we can make it one. ,556.612,559.271,2.658999999999992,45972
But I can tell you without a doubt ,559.739,561.7330000000001,1.9939999999999145,45972
that UPSTART is a watershed moment ,561.757,563.9119999999999,2.1550000000000864,45972
in the life of a child who otherwise would not be ready for school.,563.936,568.266,4.329999999999926,45972
Thank you. ,568.29,569.456,1.1660000000000537,45972
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.,25.04,30.62,5.579999999999997,47
"So I'll try and do that, ",30.644000000000002,31.834000000000003,1.1900000000000048,47
but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.,31.858,38.354,6.496000000000002,47
"And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known",38.378,41.638999999999996,3.261000000000003,47
"for most of recorded history, ",41.663,44.916000000000004,3.2529999999999935,47
"and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system,",44.94,49.717,4.777000000000001,47
"or our environment or whatever, ",49.74100000000001,52.663000000000004,2.921999999999997,47
is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution --,52.687,59.105,6.417999999999998,47
"or creation, as it used to be thought -- ",59.129,61.938,2.808999999999997,47
"and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.",61.962,68.28399999999999,6.32200000000001,47
"Nowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.",69.12100000000001,73.081,3.9600000000000084,47
"And the idea there is that outside the spaceship,",73.67699999999999,76.367,2.6899999999999977,47
"the universe is implacably hostile, ",76.391,79.304,2.9129999999999967,47
"and inside is all we have, all we depend on,",79.328,83.10400000000001,3.7760000000000105,47
"and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,",83.12799999999999,86.33500000000002,3.2070000000000083,47
we've got nowhere else to go. ,86.35900000000002,88.23200000000001,1.8729999999999905,47
"Now, the second thing that everyone already knows",88.256,90.958,2.701999999999998,47
"is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history,",90.98200000000001,96.427,5.445000000000007,47
"human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.",96.451,102.245,5.793999999999998,47
"As Stephen Hawking famously said, ",102.26899999999999,104.51,2.241,47
we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet,104.53399999999999,109.43,4.896000000000001,47
"that's in orbit around a typical star, ",109.454,111.74,2.2860000000000014,47
"which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.",111.764,115.662,3.8979999999999957,47
"Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying",116.79899999999999,121.64,4.841000000000008,47
"that we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on.",121.66400000000002,126.90299999999999,5.23899999999999,47
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.,126.927,129.784,2.856999999999985,47
"And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by",129.808,134.66899999999998,4.861000000000018,47
"and to inform your life decisions, ",134.69299999999998,136.834,2.140999999999991,47
then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.,136.858,142.155,5.296999999999997,47
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.,143.338,148.695,5.356999999999998,47
(Laughter) ,148.719,150.1,1.3810000000000002,47
And they are. ,150.124,151.454,1.3300000000000125,47
So let me start with the second one: typical.,152.191,158.69500000000005,6.504000000000019,47
"Well, is this a typical place? ",159.42700000000002,162.009,2.582000000000022,47
"Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction,",162.03300000000004,164.99800000000005,2.9650000000000034,47
and we see a wall and chemical scum -- ,165.02200000000005,170.61100000000005,5.588999999999999,47
(Laughter) ,170.63500000000005,172.02100000000004,1.3859999999999957,47

All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction,176.71,180.17700000000002,3.4669999999999845,47
"and look back, ",180.201,181.373,1.1720000000000257,47
and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all --,181.397,184.68200000000002,3.2849999999999686,47
all you see is a blue planet. ,184.706,186.49200000000002,1.7860000000000014,47
"And if you go further than that, ",186.516,189.135,2.619000000000028,47
"you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on,",189.159,193.44799999999998,4.288999999999987,47
"but that's still not typical of the universe,",193.472,195.60299999999998,2.131,47
because stars come in galaxies. ,195.627,199.01,3.3830000000000098,47
"And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,",199.034,203.753,4.718999999999994,47
is nowhere near any galaxies. ,203.777,205.834,2.056999999999988,47
"So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy,",205.858,210.55599999999998,4.698000000000008,47
"and look back, ",210.58,211.74099999999999,1.1610000000000014,47
"and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.",211.765,216.267,4.501999999999981,47
"And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.",217.237,222.618,5.381,47

into intergalactic space. ,234.172,236.252,2.0800000000000125,47
"And so, what does that look like -- ""typical?""",236.72799999999998,239.771,3.0430000000000064,47

you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.,289.58399999999995,292.73400000000004,3.150000000000034,47
That's how big and how dark the universe is.,293.525,296.62,3.0950000000000277,47
"And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright,",296.644,301.517,4.872999999999991,47
"so brilliant an event, ",301.541,303.986,2.444999999999993,47
that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.,304.01,308.14,4.129999999999996,47

"And yet, from intergalactic space, ",309.807,311.722,1.9150000000000205,47
it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. ,311.746,314.181,2.4350000000000023,47
It's also very cold out there -- ,314.205,317.218,3.012999999999977,47
less than three degrees above absolute zero.,317.242,320.387,3.1450000000000387,47

I think there are various reasons. ,819.8580000000001,821.8580000000001,2.0,73

I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- ,827.8580000000001,829.8580000000001,2.0,73

And I now find that bedtime stories ,1101.8580000000004,1104.8580000000004,3.0,73

One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint. ,67.858,71.858,4.0,74
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable. ,71.858,75.858,4.0,74

have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this. ,84.85799999999999,88.85799999999999,4.0,74

some people even say 10 planets to make it. ,95.85799999999999,98.85799999999999,3.0,74
Clearly we don't have 10 planets. ,98.85799999999999,100.85799999999999,2.0,74
"Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet, ",100.85799999999999,102.85799999999999,2.0,74

We don't have that. So that's one problem. ,104.85799999999999,107.85799999999999,3.0,74
The second problem is that the planet that we have ,107.85799999999999,109.85799999999999,2.0,74
is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right? ,109.85799999999999,113.85799999999999,4.0,74

"So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet. ",144.858,148.858,4.0,74
A third of the people on this planet are kids. ,148.858,151.858,3.0,74

"And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque, ",180.858,183.858,3.0,74
we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly ,183.858,187.858,4.0,74
facing situations which are simply unthinkable. ,187.858,191.858,4.0,74
Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios. ,191.858,193.858,2.0,74

"which promotes stability and democracy and human rights, ",215.858,219.858,4.0,74
and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary ,219.858,222.858,3.0,74
to make it through the challenges we face. ,222.858,225.858,3.0,74
We don't know how to do this yet. ,225.858,227.858,2.0,74
So what's Worldchanging? ,227.858,229.858,2.0,74
"Well, Worldchanging you might think of ",229.858,231.858,2.0,74
as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future. ,231.858,236.858,5.0,74
"You know, what we're out there doing is looking ",236.858,238.858,2.0,74
"for examples of tools, models and ideas, ",238.858,241.858,3.0,74
"which, if widely adopted, would change the game. ",241.858,245.858,4.0,74
"A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things ",245.858,248.858,3.0,74
"that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of, ",248.858,251.858,3.0,74
but most people haven't. ,251.858,253.858,2.0,74
"So I thought today I'd do something a little different, ",253.858,255.858,2.0,74
"and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know, ",255.858,258.858,3.0,74
rather than giving you tried-and-true examples. ,258.858,261.858,3.0,74
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. ,261.858,263.858,2.0,74
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook. ,263.858,265.858,2.0,74
"And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick. ",265.858,268.858,3.0,74
"So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right? ",268.858,270.85799999999995,1.9999999999999432,74
"So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city. ",270.85799999999995,273.85799999999995,3.0,74
One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world ,273.85799999999995,276.85799999999995,3.0,74
for changing the impact that we have on the planet ,276.85799999999995,278.85799999999995,2.0,74
is changing the way that we live in cities. ,278.85799999999995,280.85799999999995,2.0,74
We're already an urban planet; ,280.85799999999995,281.85799999999995,1.0,74
that's especially true in the developed world. ,281.85799999999995,284.85799999999995,3.0,74
And people who live in cities in the developed world ,284.85799999999995,286.85799999999995,2.0,74
"tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff. ",286.85799999999995,288.85799999999995,2.0,74
"If we can change the dynamic, ",288.85799999999995,290.85799999999995,2.0,74
by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... ,290.85799999999995,293.85799999999995,3.0,74
"Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, ",293.85799999999995,295.85799999999995,2.0,74
you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. ,295.85799999999995,297.85799999999995,2.0,74
"And they are doing density, new density, ",297.85799999999995,299.85799999999995,2.0,74
better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. ,299.85799999999995,301.85799999999995,2.0,74
"They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars, ",301.85799999999995,304.85799999999995,3.0,74
which is a pretty great thing. ,304.85799999999995,306.85799999999995,2.0,74
So you have density. You also have growth management. ,306.85799999999995,308.85799999999995,2.0,74
You leave aside what is natural to be natural. ,308.85799999999995,311.85799999999995,3.0,74
This is in Portland. That is an actual development. ,311.85799999999995,314.858,3.000000000000057,74
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity. ,314.858,316.858,2.0,74
They've bounded the city with a line. ,316.858,318.858,2.0,74
"Nature, city. Nothing changes. ",318.858,320.858,2.0,74
"Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments. ",321.858,324.858,3.0,74
"You can start doing things like, you know, ",324.858,326.858,2.0,74
"transit systems that actually work to transport people, ",326.858,329.85799999999995,2.999999999999943,74
in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. ,329.85799999999995,332.85799999999995,3.0,74
You can also start to change what you build. ,332.85799999999995,334.85799999999995,2.0,74
"This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London, ",334.85799999999995,337.85799999999995,3.0,74
which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place. ,337.85799999999995,340.85799999999995,3.0,74
"We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity, ",340.85799999999995,343.85799999999995,3.0,74
"that recycle much of their water, ",343.85799999999995,345.85799999999995,2.0,74
"that are much more comfortable than standard buildings, ",345.85799999999995,348.85799999999995,3.0,74
"use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less. ",348.85799999999995,352.85799999999995,4.0,74
"Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much. ",352.85799999999995,356.85799999999995,4.0,74
But once you also have people living ,356.85799999999995,358.85799999999995,2.0,74
"in close proximity to each other, ",358.85799999999995,360.858,2.0,74
one of the things you can do is -- ,360.858,362.858,2.0,74
as information technologies develop -- ,362.858,364.858,2.0,74
you can start to have smart places. ,364.858,366.858,2.0,74
You can start to know where things are. ,366.858,368.858,2.0,74
"When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them. ",368.858,370.858,2.0,74
"When you share them, you end up using less. ",370.858,373.858,3.000000000000057,74
"So one great example is car-share clubs, ",373.858,375.858,2.0,74
"which are really starting to take off in the U.S., ",375.858,377.858,2.0,74
"have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example. ",377.858,380.858,3.0,74
"If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, ",380.858,382.858,2.0,74
do you really need your own car? ,382.858,384.858,2.0,74
Another thing that information technology lets us do ,385.858,387.858,2.0,74
is start figuring out how to use less stuff ,387.858,389.858,1.9999999999999432,74
"by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using. ",389.858,394.858,5.0,74
"So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use, ",394.858,397.858,3.0,74
"which I think is a pretty cool concept, ",397.858,399.858,2.0,74
"although I think it ought to work the other way around, ",399.858,401.858,2.0,74
that it gets brighter the more you don't use. ,401.858,404.858,3.0,74
"But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach. ",404.858,406.858,2.0,74
We could just re-label things. ,406.858,408.858,2.0,74
"This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods, ",408.858,410.858,2.0,74
"and on the other hand, off. ",410.858,412.858,2.0,74
How we build things can change as well. ,412.858,414.858,2.0,74
This is a bio-morphic building. ,414.858,416.858,2.0,74
It takes its inspiration in form from life. ,416.858,420.858,4.0,74
"Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful, ",420.858,422.858,2.0,74
and also much more effective. ,422.858,424.858,2.0,74
"This is an example of bio-mimicry, ",425.858,427.858,2.0,74
which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. ,427.858,429.858,2.0,74
"In this case, you have a shell design ",429.858,431.858,2.0,74
"which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective. ",431.858,435.858,4.000000000000057,74
There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable. ,435.858,438.858,3.0,74
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. ,439.858,441.858,2.0,74
We're starting to cover this more and more. ,441.858,443.858,2.0,74
"There's also neo-biological design, ",443.858,445.858,2.0,74
where more and more we're actually using life itself ,445.858,447.858,2.0,74
and the processes of life to become part of our industry. ,447.858,450.858,2.999999999999943,74
"So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae. ",450.858,453.858,3.0,74
"So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for ",453.858,457.858,4.0,74
"of how to take the cities most of us live in, ",457.858,460.858,3.0,74
and turn them into Bright Green cities. ,460.858,462.858,2.0,74
"But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. ",462.858,467.858,5.0,74
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. ,467.858,470.858,3.0,74
"And there's a statistic I often like to use, ",470.858,472.858,2.0,74
"which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days, ",472.858,475.858,3.0,74
a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days. ,475.858,478.858,3.0,74
"I was giving a talk about two months ago, ",478.858,480.858,2.0,74
"and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me ",480.858,482.858,2.0,74
"and was really flustered, and he said, look, ",482.858,484.858,2.0,74
you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong. ,484.858,486.858,2.0,74
It's every seven days. ,486.858,488.858,2.0,74
"So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days, ",489.858,492.858,3.0,74
and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. ,492.858,496.858,4.000000000000057,74
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly. ,496.858,499.858,3.0,74
They don't have existing infrastructure; ,499.858,501.858,2.0,74
"they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty, ",501.858,504.858,3.0,74
and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out ,504.858,506.858,2.0,74
how to do things in new ways. ,506.858,508.858,2.0,74
So what do we need in order to make developing nation ,508.858,512.8580000000001,3.999999999999943,74
megacities into Bright Green megacities? ,512.8580000000001,515.8580000000001,3.0,74
"Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging. ",515.8580000000001,518.8580000000001,3.0,74
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. ,518.8580000000001,521.8580000000001,3.0,74
The idea behind leapfrogging is that ,521.8580000000001,523.8580000000001,2.0,74
"if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation ",523.8580000000001,526.8580000000001,3.0,74
"where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need, ",526.8580000000001,529.8580000000001,3.0,74
there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right? ,529.8580000000001,535.8580000000001,6.0,74
"That you're much better off, almost universally, ",535.8580000000001,537.8580000000001,2.0,74
looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. ,537.8580000000001,542.8580000000001,5.0,74
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right? ,542.8580000000001,546.8580000000001,4.0,74
"All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones, ",546.8580000000001,550.8580000000001,4.0,74
skipping the whole landline stage. ,550.8580000000001,552.8580000000001,2.0,74
"If there are landlines in many developing world cities, ",552.8580000000001,554.8580000000001,2.0,74
they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot ,554.8580000000001,557.8580000000001,3.0,74
and cost enormous amounts of money. ,557.8580000000001,559.8580000000001,2.0,74
So I rather like this picture here. ,559.8580000000001,561.8580000000001,2.0,74
"I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone. ",561.8580000000001,565.8580000000001,4.0,74
"So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society. ",565.8580000000001,569.8580000000001,4.0,74
"We've heard all about this here this week, ",569.8580000000001,571.8580000000001,2.0,74
"so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say ",571.8580000000001,573.8580000000001,2.0,74
what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. ,573.8580000000001,578.8580000000001,5.0,74
"The second thing is tools for collaboration, ",578.8580000000001,581.8580000000001,3.0,74
"be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems ",581.8580000000001,584.8580000000001,3.0,74
which encourage collaboration. Right? ,584.8580000000001,586.8580000000001,2.0,74
"When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate, ",586.8580000000001,590.8580000000001,4.0,74
you get different kinds of solutions. ,590.8580000000001,592.8580000000001,2.0,74
And those solutions are accessible in a different way ,592.8580000000001,595.8580000000001,3.0,74
to people who don't have capital. Right? ,595.8580000000001,597.8580000000001,2.0,74
"So, you know, we have open source software, ",597.8580000000001,600.8580000000001,3.0,74
we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. ,600.8580000000001,605.8580000000001,5.0,74
And those things lead to things like this. ,605.8580000000001,607.8580000000001,2.0,74
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo. ,607.8580000000001,610.8580000000001,3.0,74
This is a pretty remarkable program ,610.8580000000001,612.8580000000001,2.0,74
"using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines, ",612.8580000000001,616.8580000000001,4.0,74
and basically sort of abandoned buildings -- ,616.8580000000001,619.8580000000001,3.0,74
has put together a bunch of community centers ,619.8580000000001,621.8580000000001,2.0,74
"where people can come in, get high-speed internet access, ",621.8580000000001,624.8580000000001,3.0,74
learn computer programming skills for free. ,624.8580000000001,627.8580000000001,3.0,74
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. ,628.8580000000001,631.8580000000001,3.0,74
And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo. ,632.8580000000001,635.8580000000001,3.0,74
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter) ,635.8580000000001,638.8580000000001,3.0,74
So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion. ,639.8580000000001,644.8580000000001,5.0,74
"And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging ",644.8580000000001,647.8580000000001,3.0,74
"is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself, ",647.8580000000001,651.8580000000001,4.0,74
and re-categorizing itself in ways ,651.8580000000001,654.8580000000001,3.0,74
that have less and less to do with most of us in this room. ,654.8580000000001,657.8580000000001,3.0,74
"So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right? ",657.8580000000001,662.8580000000001,5.0,74
"You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. ",662.8580000000001,665.8580000000001,3.0,74
It's doing something new. There's new things happening. ,665.8580000000001,668.8580000000001,3.0,74
"There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things. ",668.8580000000001,671.8580000000001,3.0,74

You have other radical examples ,680.8580000000001,682.8580000000001,2.0,74
where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. ,682.8580000000001,685.8580000000001,3.0,74
These are people who have just been visited by ,685.8580000000001,687.8580000000001,2.0,74

So you also have the ability for people to start coming together ,694.8580000000001,698.8580000000001,4.0,74
"and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways, ",698.8580000000001,703.8580000000001,5.0,74

And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right? ,731.8580000000001,735.8580000000001,4.0,74
We tweak that a lot. ,735.8580000000001,737.8580000000001,2.0,74
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here. ,737.8580000000001,740.8580000000001,3.0,74

"there being a different, vague possibility out there, ",742.8580000000001,746.8580000000001,4.0,74

"OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that. ",756.8580000000001,760.8580000000001,4.0,74

"but one of the things that he's doing is, ",762.8580000000001,764.8580000000001,2.0,74
he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that ,764.8580000000001,770.8580000000001,6.0,74
completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue ,770.8580000000001,776.8580000000001,6.0,74

"is the rise of these games that are what we call ""serious play."" ",786.8580000000001,790.8580000000001,4.0,74

there are spearers and smashers. ,92.85799999999999,94.85799999999999,2.0,77
"And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod. ",94.85799999999999,97.85799999999999,3.0,77
"And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead. ",97.85799999999999,102.85799999999999,5.0,77
"So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit, ",102.85799999999999,107.85799999999999,5.0,77
this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species -- ,107.85799999999999,109.85799999999999,2.0,77
"recorded at 1,000 frames a second, ",109.85799999999999,111.85799999999999,2.0,77
played back at 15 frames per second. ,111.85799999999999,113.85799999999999,2.0,77
"And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs, ",113.85799999999999,119.85799999999999,6.0,77
exploding upward to actually just catch ,119.85799999999999,122.85799999999999,3.0,77
a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it. ,122.85799999999999,124.85799999999999,2.0,77
"Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, ",124.85799999999999,129.858,5.0,77
and these guys open up snails for a living. ,129.858,132.858,3.0,77
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack. ,132.858,137.858,5.0,77
(Laughter) ,137.858,138.858,1.0,77
"So, I'll play it one more time. ",138.858,140.858,2.0,77
"He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash. ",140.858,144.858,4.0,77
"And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner. ",144.858,151.858,7.0,77
"So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end, ",151.858,155.858,4.0,77
or it can smash with the heel. ,155.858,157.858,2.0,77
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike. ,157.858,160.858,3.0,77
"And so the first question that came to mind was, ",160.858,162.858,2.0,77
"well, how fast does this limb move? ",162.858,165.858,3.0,77
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video. ,165.858,168.858,3.0,77
And I immediately came upon a problem. ,168.858,171.858,3.0,77
Every single high-speed video system in the biology department ,171.858,174.858,3.0,77
at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement. ,174.858,178.858,4.0,77
We simply couldn't capture it on video. ,178.858,180.858,2.0,77
And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time. ,180.858,183.858,3.0,77
"And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department, ",183.858,186.858,3.0,77
looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology. ,186.858,191.858,5.0,77
And so we struck up a deal. ,191.858,193.858,2.0,77
"I said, ""Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system ",193.858,195.858,2.0,77
"that could capture these movements, ",195.858,197.858,2.0,77
"you guys can film us collecting the data."" ",197.858,200.858,3.0,77
"And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter) ",200.858,202.858,2.0,77
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology -- ,202.858,206.858,4.0,77
it just came out about a year ago -- ,206.858,208.858,2.0,77
that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light. ,208.858,213.858,5.0,77
"And low light is a critical issue with filming animals, ",213.858,215.858,2.0,77
"because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter) ",215.858,218.858,3.0,77
"So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here, ",218.858,223.858,5.0,77
"and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel. ",223.858,226.858,3.0,77
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail. ,226.858,229.858,3.0,77
"And the snail's wired to a stick, ",229.858,230.858,1.0,77
so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah. ,230.858,234.858,4.0,77
(Laughter) ,234.858,236.858,2.0,77
I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here. ,236.858,239.858,3.0,77
(Laughter) ,239.858,241.858,2.0,77
"So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second, ",241.858,246.858,5.0,77
and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times. ,246.858,251.858,5.0,77
"And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast ",251.858,254.858,3.0,77
slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement. ,254.858,258.858,4.0,77
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards -- ,258.858,261.858,3.0,77
just a spectacular movement. ,261.858,264.858,3.0,77
"And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos, ",264.858,266.858,2.0,77
and we measured how fast the limb was moving ,266.858,268.858,2.0,77
to get back to that original question. ,268.858,270.85799999999995,1.9999999999999432,77
And we were in for our first surprise. ,270.85799999999995,273.85799999999995,3.0,77
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving ,273.85799999999995,276.85799999999995,3.0,77
at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second ,276.85799999999995,278.85799999999995,2.0,77
all the way up to 23 meters per second. ,278.85799999999995,280.85799999999995,2.0,77
"And for those of you who prefer miles per hour, ",280.85799999999995,282.85799999999995,2.0,77
that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast. ,282.85799999999995,287.85799999999995,5.0,77
"In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point ",287.85799999999995,291.85799999999995,4.0,77
on the extreme animal movement spectrum. ,291.85799999999995,294.85799999999995,3.0,77
And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike ,294.85799999999995,297.85799999999995,3.0,77
of any animal system. So our first surprise. ,297.85799999999995,301.85799999999995,4.0,77
(Applause) ,301.85799999999995,302.85799999999995,1.0,77
So that was really cool and very unexpected. ,302.85799999999995,305.85799999999995,3.0,77
"So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it? ",305.85799999999995,308.85799999999995,3.0,77
"And actually, this work was done in the 1960s ",308.85799999999995,311.85799999999995,3.0,77
by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows. ,311.85799999999995,313.858,2.000000000000057,77
And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use ,313.858,316.858,3.0,77
"what's called a ""catch mechanism,"" or ""click mechanism."" ",316.858,319.858,3.0,77
And what this basically consists of is a large muscle ,319.858,323.858,4.0,77
"that takes a good long time to contract, ",323.858,325.858,2.0,77
and a latch that prevents anything from moving. ,325.858,328.858,3.0,77
"So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens. ",328.858,330.85799999999995,1.9999999999999432,77
"And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up -- ",330.85799999999995,333.85799999999995,3.0,77
"the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement. ",333.85799999999995,337.85799999999995,4.0,77
"And that's basically what's called a ""power amplification system."" ",337.85799999999995,340.85799999999995,3.0,77
"It takes a long time for the muscle to contract, ",340.85799999999995,342.85799999999995,2.0,77
and a very short time for the limb to fly out. ,342.85799999999995,344.85799999999995,2.0,77
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story. ,344.85799999999995,347.85799999999995,3.0,77
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes. ,347.85799999999995,351.85799999999995,4.0,77
But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History. ,351.85799999999995,355.85799999999995,4.0,77
"And if any of you ever have a chance, ",355.85799999999995,357.85799999999995,2.0,77
backstage of the National Museum of Natural History ,357.85799999999995,359.85799999999995,2.0,77
is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what -- ,359.85799999999995,363.858,4.0,77
(Laughter) ,363.858,364.858,1.0,77
this is serious business for me. ,364.858,366.858,2.0,77
(Laughter) ,366.858,367.858,1.0,77
"So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, ",367.858,372.858,5.0,77
"whether it's a spearer or a smasher, ",372.858,374.858,2.000000000000057,77
is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure ,374.858,376.858,2.0,77
right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here. ,376.858,380.858,4.0,77
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse. ,380.858,382.858,2.0,77
It's a very beautiful structure. ,382.858,384.858,2.0,77
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas ,384.858,389.858,4.999999999999943,77
suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure. ,389.858,393.858,4.0,77
And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while. ,393.858,396.858,3.0,77
"And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show ",396.858,400.858,4.0,77
is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. ,400.858,404.858,4.0,77
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism ,404.858,407.858,3.0,77
"in order to generate the amount of force that we observe, ",407.858,409.858,2.0,77
"and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system. ",409.858,412.858,3.0,77
"So we thought, OK, this must be a spring -- ",412.858,415.858,3.0,77
the saddle could very well be a spring. ,415.858,417.858,2.0,77
"And we went back to those high-speed videos again, ",417.858,419.858,2.0,77
and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending. ,419.858,425.858,6.0,77
And I'll just do that one more time. ,425.858,428.858,3.0,77
And then if you take a look at the video -- ,428.858,430.858,2.0,77
it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow. ,430.858,432.858,2.0,77
The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it ,432.858,434.858,2.000000000000057,77
"extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending. ",434.858,438.858,4.0,77
"So, we've had very solid evidence showing ",438.858,440.858,2.0,77
"that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends, ",440.858,444.858,4.0,77
"and does, in fact, function as a spring. ",444.858,446.858,2.0,77
"The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a ""hyperbolic paraboloid surface,"" ",446.858,451.858,4.999999999999943,77
"or an ""anticlastic surface."" ",451.858,453.858,2.0,77
"And this is very well known to engineers and architects, ",453.858,455.858,2.0,77
because it's a very strong surface in compression. ,455.858,458.858,3.0,77
"It has curves in two directions, ",458.858,460.858,2.0,77
"one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other, ",460.858,463.858,3.0,77
so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces ,463.858,466.858,3.0,77
over the surface of this type of shape. ,466.858,469.858,3.0,77
"So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists. ",469.858,473.858,4.0,77
"It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry, ",473.858,477.858,4.0,77
because it requires very little material ,477.858,480.858,3.0,77
"to build this type of surface, and it's very strong. ",480.858,483.858,3.0,77
"So if you're going to build a thin gold structure, ",483.858,485.858,2.0,77
it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong. ,485.858,487.858,2.0,77
"Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects ",487.858,492.858,5.0,77
"is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure. ",492.858,495.858,3.000000000000057,77
And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built ,495.858,498.858,3.0,77
that's 87 and a half feet spanwise. ,498.858,502.858,4.0,77
"It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points. ",502.858,505.858,3.0,77
And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's -- ,505.858,510.858,4.999999999999943,77
he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure ,510.858,514.8580000000001,4.0,77
that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points. ,514.8580000000001,518.8580000000001,4.0,77
And all of these are the same principles that apply ,518.8580000000001,522.8580000000001,4.0,77
to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods. ,522.8580000000001,524.8580000000001,2.0,77
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot ,524.8580000000001,527.8580000000001,3.0,77
of extra material requirements for building it. ,527.8580000000001,530.8580000000001,3.0,77
"So, very interesting parallels between the biological ",530.8580000000001,533.8580000000001,3.0,77
"and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out -- ",533.8580000000001,537.8580000000001,4.0,77
the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first ,537.8580000000001,539.8580000000001,2.0,77
described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring. ,539.8580000000001,542.8580000000001,3.0,77
"That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting. ",542.8580000000001,545.8580000000001,3.0,77
"So the next and final question was, well, how much force ",545.8580000000001,548.8580000000001,3.0,77
does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails? ,548.8580000000001,552.8580000000001,4.0,77
And so I wired up what's called a load cell. ,552.8580000000001,554.8580000000001,2.0,77
"A load cell measures forces, and this is actually ",554.8580000000001,556.8580000000001,2.0,77
a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it. ,556.8580000000001,559.8580000000001,3.0,77
"And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change ",559.8580000000001,563.8580000000001,4.0,77
and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in. ,563.8580000000001,565.8580000000001,2.0,77
"So these animals are wonderfully aggressive, ",565.8580000000001,568.8580000000001,3.0,77
and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do ,568.8580000000001,571.8580000000001,3.0,77
"was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, ",571.8580000000001,574.8580000000001,3.0,77
and they'd smash away at it. ,574.8580000000001,576.8580000000001,2.0,77
And so this is just a regular video of the animal ,576.8580000000001,580.8580000000001,4.0,77
just smashing the heck out of this load cell. ,580.8580000000001,583.8580000000001,3.0,77
And we were able to get some force measurements out. ,583.8580000000001,586.8580000000001,3.0,77
"And again, we were in for a surprise. ",586.8580000000001,588.8580000000001,2.0,77
"I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking, ",588.8580000000001,590.8580000000001,2.0,77
no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal. ,590.8580000000001,594.8580000000001,4.0,77
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell. ,594.8580000000001,596.8580000000001,2.0,77
So these are actually some old data ,596.8580000000001,598.8580000000001,2.0,77
"where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab, ",598.8580000000001,600.8580000000001,2.0,77
and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds ,600.8580000000001,603.8580000000001,3.0,77
generated by an animal about this big. ,603.8580000000001,606.8580000000001,3.0,77
"And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell ",606.8580000000001,608.8580000000001,2.0,77
"up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating ",608.8580000000001,611.8580000000001,3.0,77
well over 200 pounds of force. ,611.8580000000001,613.8580000000001,2.0,77
"And again, I think this will be a world record. ",613.8580000000001,616.8580000000001,3.0,77
"I have to do a little bit more background reading, ",616.8580000000001,618.8580000000001,2.0,77
but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced ,618.8580000000001,621.8580000000001,3.0,77
"by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces. ",621.8580000000001,626.8580000000001,5.0,77
"And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring ",626.8580000000001,629.8580000000001,3.0,77
in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system. ,629.8580000000001,633.8580000000001,4.0,77
But that was not the end of the story. ,633.8580000000001,635.8580000000001,2.0,77
"Now, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work. ",635.8580000000001,638.8580000000001,3.0,77
"And I got all these force measurements, ",638.8580000000001,640.8580000000001,2.0,77
and then I went and looked at the force output of the system. ,640.8580000000001,644.8580000000001,4.0,77
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis ,644.8580000000001,647.8580000000001,3.0,77
and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks. ,647.8580000000001,650.8580000000001,3.0,77
And that was what really got me puzzled. ,650.8580000000001,654.8580000000001,4.0,77
"The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell. ",654.8580000000001,657.8580000000001,3.0,77
"But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later, ",657.8580000000001,663.8580000000001,6.0,77
and I didn't know what that was. ,663.8580000000001,665.8580000000001,2.0,77
"So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons, ",665.8580000000001,668.8580000000001,3.0,77
but not half a millisecond later. ,668.8580000000001,670.8580000000001,2.0,77
"Again, going back to those high-speed videos, ",670.8580000000001,672.8580000000001,2.0,77
there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on. ,672.8580000000001,676.8580000000001,4.0,77
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier. ,676.8580000000001,678.8580000000001,2.0,77
"There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel, ",678.8580000000001,681.8580000000001,3.0,77
and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell. ,681.8580000000001,684.8580000000001,3.0,77
"And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this, ",684.8580000000001,687.8580000000001,3.0,77
"on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through. ",687.8580000000001,692.8580000000001,5.0,77
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light. ,692.8580000000001,697.8580000000001,5.0,77
Audience: Wow. ,697.8580000000001,699.8580000000001,2.0,77
"Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there ",699.8580000000001,703.8580000000001,4.0,77
at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble. ,703.8580000000001,706.8580000000001,3.0,77
"And what that is, is cavitation. ",706.8580000000001,708.8580000000001,2.0,77
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon ,708.8580000000001,712.8580000000001,4.0,77
which occurs when you have areas of water ,712.8580000000001,715.8580000000001,3.0,77
moving at extremely different speeds. ,715.8580000000001,717.8580000000001,2.0,77
"And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure, ",717.8580000000001,721.8580000000001,4.0,77
which results in the water literally vaporizing. ,721.8580000000001,724.8580000000001,3.0,77
"And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, ",724.8580000000001,728.8580000000001,4.0,77
and it's a very destructive process. ,728.8580000000001,730.8580000000001,2.0,77
"And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation ",730.8580000000001,735.8580000000001,5.0,77
"where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon, ",735.8580000000001,738.8580000000001,3.0,77
because it destroys boat propellers. ,738.8580000000001,740.8580000000001,2.0,77
People have been struggling for years to try and design ,740.8580000000001,743.8580000000001,3.0,77
a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate ,743.8580000000001,747.8580000000001,4.0,77
"and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, ",747.8580000000001,749.8580000000001,2.0,77
just like these pictures show. ,749.8580000000001,751.8580000000001,2.0,77
"So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, ",751.8580000000001,760.8580000000001,9.0,77
I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. ,760.8580000000001,763.8580000000001,3.0,77
"This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give ",763.8580000000001,767.8580000000001,4.0,77
"full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up, ",767.8580000000001,771.8580000000001,4.0,77
because I could never have done this in a million years -- ,771.8580000000001,774.8580000000001,3.0,77
one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen. ,774.8580000000001,777.8580000000001,3.0,77
"You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light, ",777.8580000000001,781.8580000000001,4.0,77
and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail. ,781.8580000000001,785.8580000000001,4.0,77
"So really, just an amazing image, ",785.8580000000001,788.8580000000001,3.0,77
"slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds. ",788.8580000000001,792.8580000000001,4.0,77
"And again, we can see it in slightly different form there, ",792.8580000000001,795.8580000000001,3.0,77
with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces. ,795.8580000000001,799.8580000000001,4.0,77
"In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb. ",799.8580000000001,804.8580000000001,5.0,77
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks: ,804.8580000000001,807.8580000000001,3.0,77
what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually ,807.8580000000001,809.8580000000001,2.0,77
"the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually ",809.8580000000001,812.8580000000001,3.0,77
the collapse of the cavitation bubble. ,812.8580000000001,814.8580000000001,2.0,77
And these animals may very well be making use of ,814.8580000000001,817.8580000000001,3.0,77
"not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring, ",817.8580000000001,821.8580000000001,4.0,77
but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be ,821.8580000000001,825.8580000000001,4.0,77
making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail. ,825.8580000000001,829.8580000000001,4.0,77
"So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals. ",829.8580000000001,835.8580000000001,6.0,77
"So, one question I often get after this talk -- ",835.8580000000001,837.8580000000001,2.0,77
"so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal? ",837.8580000000001,840.8580000000001,3.0,77
"Because obviously, if it's breaking snails, ",840.8580000000001,843.8580000000001,3.0,77
the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does. ,843.8580000000001,846.8580000000001,3.0,77
"That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images, ",846.8580000000001,849.8580000000001,3.0,77
"and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away ",849.8580000000001,851.8580000000001,2.0,77
their heel all the way to the flesh. ,851.8580000000001,853.8580000000001,2.0,77
But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod ,853.8580000000001,856.8580000000001,3.0,77
is that you have to molt. And every three months or so ,856.8580000000001,859.8580000000001,3.0,77
"these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem. ",859.8580000000001,864.8580000000001,5.0,77
"Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem. ",864.8580000000001,868.8580000000001,4.0,77
"So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note. ",868.8580000000001,873.8580000000001,5.0,77
(Laughter) ,873.8580000000001,876.8580000000001,3.0,77
"Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know. ",876.8580000000001,880.8580000000001,4.0,77
(Laughter) ,880.8580000000001,881.8580000000001,1.0,77
"So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring -- ",881.8580000000001,884.8580000000001,3.0,77
"has actually been well known to biologists for a long time, ",884.8580000000001,888.8580000000001,4.0,77
not as a spring but as a visual signal. ,888.8580000000001,892.8580000000001,4.0,77
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot ,892.8580000000001,894.8580000000001,2.0,77
in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods. ,894.8580000000001,900.8580000000001,6.0,77
"And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins ",900.8580000000001,903.8580000000001,3.0,77
"of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring. ",903.8580000000001,909.8580000000001,6.0,77
And I think one explanation for this could be ,909.8580000000001,911.8580000000001,2.0,77
going back to the molting phenomenon. ,911.8580000000001,913.8580000000001,2.0,77
So these animals go into a molting period where they're ,913.8580000000001,916.8580000000001,3.0,77
unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft. ,916.8580000000001,919.8580000000001,3.0,77
And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct. ,919.8580000000001,922.8580000000001,3.0,77
"This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period ",922.8580000000001,929.8580000000001,7.0,77
"when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, ",929.8580000000001,932.8580000000001,3.0,77
and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what. ,932.8580000000001,936.8580000000001,4.0,77
"And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more, ",936.8580000000001,940.8580000000001,4.0,77
they just signal. They wave their legs around. ,940.8580000000001,943.8580000000001,3.0,77
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing. ,943.8580000000001,947.8580000000001,4.0,77
It's a well-established fact of these animals ,947.8580000000001,949.8580000000001,2.0,77
"that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to. ",949.8580000000001,953.8580000000001,4.0,77
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots ,953.8580000000001,955.8580000000001,2.0,77
in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information ,955.8580000000001,959.8580000000001,4.0,77
"about their ability to strike, or their strike force, ",959.8580000000001,962.8580000000001,3.0,77
and something about the time period in the molting cycle. ,962.8580000000001,965.8580000000001,3.0,77
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure ,965.8580000000001,970.8580000000001,5.0,77
right in the middle of their spring. ,970.8580000000001,973.8580000000001,3.0,77
"So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators, ",973.8580000000001,978.8580000000001,5.0,77
"Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this. ",978.8580000000001,981.8580000000001,3.0,77

and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much. ,988.8580000000001,991.8580000000001,3.0,77
I thought in getting up to my TED wish ,24.858,30.858,5.9999999999999964,85
I would try to begin by putting in  perspective what I try to do,30.858,37.858000000000004,7.0,85
and how it fits with what they try to do. ,37.858000000000004,41.858000000000004,4.0,85
"We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent, ",41.858000000000004,46.858000000000004,5.0,85
but insufficient in three major ways. ,46.858000000000004,52.858000000000004,6.0,85
"It is, first of all, profoundly unequal: ",52.858000000000004,55.858000000000004,3.0,85

80 percent of them under five years of age. ,75.858,78.858,3.0,85
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing. ,78.858,84.85799999999999,6.0,85
"In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth, ",84.85799999999999,89.85799999999999,5.0,85
"five years of productivity growth in the workplace, ",89.85799999999999,92.85799999999999,3.0,85
but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families ,92.85799999999999,96.85799999999999,4.0,85
dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent. ,96.85799999999999,100.85799999999999,4.0,85

to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. ,464.858,469.858,5.0,85

"for the ""Inconvenient Truth"" movie, I was thrilled, ",572.8580000000001,576.8580000000001,4.0,85

"if we don't do anything, here's where they could go. ",592.8580000000001,594.8580000000001,2.0,85
And then there are six different categories ,594.8580000000001,596.8580000000001,2.0,85
of things we can do to change the trajectory. ,596.8580000000001,598.8580000000001,2.0,85
We need a movie on those six categories. ,598.8580000000001,601.8580000000001,3.0,85
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains ,601.8580000000001,604.8580000000001,3.0,85
and to organize yourselves around it. ,604.8580000000001,607.8580000000001,3.0,85
So we're trying to do that. ,607.8580000000001,609.8580000000001,2.0,85

"I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption, ",629.8580000000001,635.8580000000001,6.0,85

and this predictability is not there. ,762.8580000000001,765.8580000000001,3.0,85
"And it becomes almost impossible to save lives, ",765.8580000000001,768.8580000000001,3.0,85
"educate kids, develop economies, whatever. ",768.8580000000001,771.8580000000001,3.0,85
"The person, in my view, ",771.8580000000001,774.8580000000001,3.0,85
"who has done the best job of this in the health care area, ",774.8580000000001,779.8580000000001,5.0,85
"of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, ",779.8580000000001,783.8580000000001,4.0,85
"who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, ",783.8580000000001,788.8580000000001,5.0,85
"Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, ",788.8580000000001,792.8580000000001,4.0,85
"but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru ",792.8580000000001,794.8580000000001,2.0,85
and other places around the world. ,794.8580000000001,796.8580000000001,2.0,85
"As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active -- ",796.8580000000001,801.8580000000001,5.0,85
and they serve a catchment area far greater ,801.8580000000001,803.8580000000001,2.0,85
than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve -- ,803.8580000000001,807.8580000000001,4.0,85
"since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one. ",807.8580000000001,814.8580000000001,7.0,85
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. ,814.8580000000001,819.8580000000001,5.0,85
So when we decided to work in Rwanda ,819.8580000000001,823.8580000000001,4.0,85
"on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem, ",823.8580000000001,828.8580000000001,5.0,85
"we wanted to build a healthcare network, ",828.8580000000001,830.8580000000001,2.0,85
"because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994, ",830.8580000000001,834.8580000000001,4.0,85
and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. ,834.8580000000001,837.8580000000001,3.0,85
"So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help. ",838.8580000000001,842.8580000000001,4.0,85
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti ,843.8580000000001,846.8580000000001,3.0,85
"and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country, ",846.8580000000001,850.8580000000001,4.0,85
"number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country ",850.8580000000001,852.8580000000001,2.0,85
"that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years, ",852.8580000000001,856.8580000000001,4.0,85
"and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted ",856.8580000000001,860.8580000000001,4.0,85
to any other poor country anywhere in the world. ,860.8580000000001,863.8580000000001,3.0,85
And so we have set about doing that. ,864.8580000000001,868.8580000000001,4.0,85
"Now, we started working together 18 months ago. ",868.8580000000001,872.8580000000001,4.0,85
"And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza, ",872.8580000000001,876.8580000000001,4.0,85
"which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda, ",876.8580000000001,880.8580000000001,4.0,85
"with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people. ",880.8580000000001,886.8580000000001,6.0,85
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti: ,886.8580000000001,891.8580000000001,5.0,85
he develops and trains paid community health workers ,891.8580000000001,896.8580000000001,5.0,85
"who are able to identify health problems, ",896.8580000000001,900.8580000000001,4.0,85
ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed ,900.8580000000001,904.8580000000001,4.0,85
"and take their medicine regularly, ",904.8580000000001,906.8580000000001,2.0,85
"who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation, ",906.8580000000001,913.8580000000001,7.0,85
providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care ,913.8580000000001,918.8580000000001,5.0,85
if they have problems of the severity that require it. ,918.8580000000001,922.8580000000001,4.0,85
"The procedures that make this work have been perfected, ",922.8580000000001,927.8580000000001,5.0,85
"as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team ",927.8580000000001,930.8580000000001,3.0,85
in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years. ,930.8580000000001,933.8580000000001,3.0,85
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda. ,933.8580000000001,939.8580000000001,6.0,85
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government ,939.8580000000001,944.8580000000001,5.0,85
"has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country, ",944.8580000000001,947.8580000000001,3.0,85
and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. ,947.8580000000001,952.8580000000001,5.0,85
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do. ,953.8580000000001,957.8580000000001,4.0,85
We have about 500 people around the world ,957.8580000000001,960.8580000000001,3.0,85
"working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing -- ",960.8580000000001,964.8580000000001,4.0,85
"just for transportation, room and board. ",964.8580000000001,966.8580000000001,2.0,85
And then we have others working in these other related programs. ,966.8580000000001,970.8580000000001,4.0,85
Our business plan in Rwanda ,970.8580000000001,972.8580000000001,2.0,85
"was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble, ",972.8580000000001,975.8580000000001,3.0,85
"who is an unusually gifted woman, ",975.8580000000001,978.8580000000001,3.0,85
but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. ,978.8580000000001,983.8580000000001,5.0,85
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s. ,983.8580000000001,988.8580000000001,5.0,85
She was CEO of a successful e-venture -- ,988.8580000000001,990.8580000000001,2.0,85
she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures -- ,990.8580000000001,994.8580000000001,4.0,85
and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life. ,994.8580000000001,997.8580000000001,3.0,85
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay. ,997.8580000000001,1001.8580000000001,4.0,85
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan ,1001.8580000000001,1005.8580000000001,4.0,85
that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. ,1005.8580000000001,1009.8580000000001,4.0,85
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work ,1009.8580000000001,1014.8580000000001,5.0,85
she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. ,1014.8580000000001,1018.8580000000001,4.0,85
"When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five ",1018.8580000000001,1023.8580000000001,5.0,85
had stunted growth due to malnutrition. ,1023.8580000000001,1028.858,5.0,85
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five. ,1028.858,1034.858,6.0,85
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent. ,1036.858,1039.8580000000004,3.000000000000228,85
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred ,1039.8580000000004,1043.8580000000004,4.0,85
because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -- ,1043.8580000000004,1048.8580000000004,5.0,85
all entirely preventable and treatable. ,1048.8580000000004,1051.8580000000004,3.0,85
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -- ,1051.8580000000004,1055.8580000000004,4.0,85
"again, all preventable and treatable. ",1055.8580000000004,1058.8580000000004,3.0,85
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. ,1058.8580000000004,1063.8580000000004,5.0,85
"Within the first 18 months, the following things happened: ",1064.8580000000004,1068.8580000000004,4.0,85
"we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS. ",1068.8580000000004,1072.8580000000004,4.0,85
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area. ,1072.8580000000004,1076.8580000000004,4.0,85
Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated ,1076.8580000000004,1081.8580000000004,5.0,85
stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment. ,1081.8580000000004,1085.8580000000004,4.0,85
That's lower than the figure in the United States. ,1085.8580000000004,1088.8580000000004,3.0,85
Less than three-tenths of one percent ,1088.8580000000004,1090.8580000000004,2.0,85
had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs. ,1090.8580000000004,1095.8580000000004,5.0,85
"400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling ",1095.8580000000004,1099.8580000000004,4.0,85
and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system. ,1099.8580000000004,1104.8580000000004,5.0,85
That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies. ,1104.8580000000004,1109.8580000000004,5.0,85
"About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000. ",1109.8580000000004,1113.8580000000004,4.0,85
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -- ,1113.8580000000004,1117.8580000000004,4.0,85
"in just 18 months, up from zero when we started. ",1117.8580000000004,1121.8580000000004,4.0,85
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program ,1121.8580000000004,1124.8580000000004,3.0,85
to prevent malnutrition and early death ,1124.8580000000004,1126.8580000000004,2.0,85
are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow. ,1126.8580000000004,1129.8580000000004,3.0,85
We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there. ,1129.8580000000004,1133.8580000000004,4.0,85
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide ,1133.8580000000004,1138.8580000000004,5.0,85
"that we have renovated along with four other clinics, ",1138.8580000000004,1143.8580000000004,5.0,85
"complete with solar power generators, good lab technology. ",1143.8580000000004,1148.8580000000004,5.0,85
"We now are treating 325 people a month, ",1148.8580000000004,1153.8580000000004,5.0,85
despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home. ,1153.8580000000004,1158.8580000000004,5.0,85
And the most important thing is ,1159.8580000000004,1162.8580000000004,3.0,85
"because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers, ",1162.8580000000004,1167.8580000000004,5.0,85
we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda ,1167.8580000000004,1173.8580000000004,6.0,85
"for between five and six percent of GDP, ",1173.8580000000004,1177.8580000000004,4.0,85
and that the government could sustain that ,1177.8580000000004,1181.8580000000004,4.0,85
without depending on foreign aid after five or six years. ,1181.8580000000004,1186.8580000000004,5.0,85
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics ,1187.8580000000004,1189.8580000000004,2.0,85
you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP ,1189.8580000000004,1194.8580000000004,5.0,85
"on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 -- ",1194.8580000000004,1196.8580000000004,2.0,85
but that's a story for another day. ,1196.8580000000004,1198.8580000000004,2.0,85
(Laughter) ,1199.8580000000004,1200.8580000000004,1.0,85
We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda ,1201.8580000000004,1206.8580000000004,5.0,85
and our Foundation folks to scale this system up. ,1206.8580000000004,1210.8580000000004,4.0,85
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho. ,1210.8580000000004,1216.8580000000004,6.0,85
"And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique, ",1216.8580000000004,1220.8580000000004,4.0,85
Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing: ,1220.8580000000004,1225.8580000000004,5.0,85
"to save as many lives as quickly as we can, ",1225.8580000000004,1227.8580000000004,2.0,85
but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide ,1227.8580000000004,1230.8580000000004,3.0,85
and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world. ,1230.8580000000004,1234.8580000000004,4.0,85
"We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses, ",1234.8580000000004,1238.8580000000004,4.0,85
"health administration and community health workers throughout the country, ",1238.8580000000004,1241.8580000000004,3.0,85
"to set up the information technology, the solar energy, ",1241.8580000000004,1244.8580000000004,3.0,85
"the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure. ",1244.8580000000004,1247.8580000000004,3.0,85
"But over a five- to 10-year period, ",1247.8580000000004,1250.8580000000004,3.0,85
we will take down the need for outside assistance ,1250.8580000000004,1252.8580000000004,2.0,85
and eventually it will be phased out. ,1252.8580000000004,1254.8580000000004,2.0,85
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build ,1255.8580000000004,1263.8580000000004,8.0,85
"a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda, ",1263.8580000000004,1267.8580000000004,4.0,85
"that can be a model for Africa, ",1267.8580000000004,1269.8580000000004,2.0,85
"and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world. ",1269.8580000000004,1274.8580000000004,5.0,85
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world ,1274.8580000000004,1280.8580000000004,6.0,85
"with more partners and fewer terrorists, ",1280.8580000000004,1283.8580000000004,3.0,85
"with more productive citizens and fewer haters, ",1283.8580000000004,1286.8580000000004,3.0,85
a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in. ,1286.8580000000004,1291.8580000000004,5.0,85
"It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda ",1292.8580000000004,1298.8580000000004,6.0,85

the first thing I did when I went out to this place ,1363.8580000000004,1365.8580000000004,2.0,85
was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt ,1365.8580000000004,1367.8580000000004,2.0,85
and see what they'd done with it. ,1367.8580000000004,1369.8580000000004,2.0,85

"I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve ",115.85799999999999,120.85799999999999,5.0,91

does to people we think we will never see and never know. ,130.858,133.858,3.0,91
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story ,134.858,137.858,3.0,91
of what aid is and can be. ,137.858,139.858,2.0,91
"That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia, ",139.858,143.858,4.0,91
"and moved its way into the larger industry, ",143.858,146.858,3.0,91

"So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986, ",168.858,173.858,5.0,91
where I was doing two things. ,173.858,174.858,1.0,91
I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers. ,174.858,177.858,3.0,91

"we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali, ",179.858,182.858,3.0,91

"And because we had a good business model, we actually did it, ",186.858,189.858,3.0,91
and I watched these women transform on a micro-level. ,189.858,191.858,2.0,91

"which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks, ",197.858,200.858,3.0,91
which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme -- ,200.858,202.858,2.0,91
"but then it was quite new, especially in an economy ",203.858,206.858,3.0,91

We got a lot of things right. ,209.858,211.858,2.0,91
We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game. ,211.858,214.858,3.0,91
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day ,214.858,217.858,3.0,91
as to how they would use this access to credit ,217.858,219.858,2.0,91
"to build their little businesses, earn more income ",219.858,222.858,3.0,91
so they could take care of their families better. ,222.858,224.858,2.0,91

"and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into ",236.858,240.858,4.0,91
"this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, ",241.858,247.858,6.0,91
"that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid. ",247.858,250.858,3.0,91
"The genocide happened in 1994, ",250.858,252.858,2.0,91
seven years after these women all worked together ,252.858,254.858,2.0,91
to build this dream. ,254.858,256.858,2.0,91
"And the good news was that the institution, ",256.858,258.858,2.0,91
"the banking institution, lasted. ",258.858,260.858,2.0,91
"In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country. ",260.858,263.858,3.0,91
"The bakery was completely wiped out, ",264.858,266.858,2.0,91
but the lessons for me were that accountability counts -- ,266.858,270.85799999999995,3.999999999999943,91
"got to build things with people on the ground, ",271.85799999999995,273.85799999999995,2.0,91
"using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say, ",273.85799999999995,276.85799999999995,3.0,91

"Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter. ",278.85799999999995,282.85799999999995,4.0,91
So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything ,282.85799999999995,286.85799999999995,4.0,91
"that was happening in the world, ",286.85799999999995,288.85799999999995,2.0,91
"that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist, ",288.85799999999995,290.85799999999995,2.0,91
"on the one hand I absolutely agree with him, ",290.85799999999995,292.85799999999995,2.0,91

"that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono ",295.85799999999995,299.85799999999995,4.0,91

the world is talking about Africa ,303.85799999999995,305.85799999999995,2.0,91
in ways I have never seen in my life. ,305.85799999999995,307.85799999999995,2.0,91
It's thrilling. ,307.85799999999995,308.85799999999995,1.0,91
"And at the same time, what keeps me up at night ",308.85799999999995,311.85799999999995,3.0,91
is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 -- ,311.85799999999995,315.858,4.000000000000057,91
"50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa, ",315.858,318.858,3.0,91
"40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory, ",318.858,321.858,3.0,91
"as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution. ",321.858,325.858,4.0,91
"And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one, ",325.858,329.85799999999995,3.999999999999943,91
"celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two ",329.85799999999995,333.85799999999995,4.0,91
"that is all about execution, all about the how-to. ",333.85799999999995,335.85799999999995,2.0,91
"And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, ",336.85799999999995,339.85799999999995,3.0,91
"it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, ",339.85799999999995,343.85799999999995,4.0,91
is to build viable systems on the ground ,343.85799999999995,346.85799999999995,3.0,91
"that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, ",346.85799999999995,350.85799999999995,4.0,91

"If we do that, we really can make poverty history. ",353.85799999999995,356.85799999999995,3.0,91
And it was that -- that whole philosophy -- ,356.85799999999995,359.85799999999995,3.0,91
that encouraged me to start my current endeavor ,359.85799999999995,363.858,4.0,91
"called ""Acumen Fund,"" ",363.858,365.858,2.0,91

so you can see what it is that we're doing. ,378.858,380.858,2.0,91
But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves -- ,380.858,383.858,3.0,91
I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are. ,383.858,385.858,2.0,91
Because we too often talk about them as these ,385.858,389.858,3.999999999999943,91

and yet most of these people go invisible. ,407.858,409.858,2.0,91
"Where we typically work, there's people making between ",410.858,412.858,2.0,91
one and three dollars a day. ,412.858,414.858,2.0,91
Who are these people? ,414.858,416.858,2.0,91
They are farmers and factory workers. ,416.858,419.858,3.0,91
They work in government offices. They're drivers. ,419.858,421.858,2.0,91
They are domestics. ,421.858,424.858,3.0,91
"They typically pay for critical goods and services like water, ",424.858,427.858,3.0,91
"like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times ",427.858,431.858,4.0,91
what their middleclass counterparts pay -- ,431.858,433.858,2.000000000000057,91
certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi. ,433.858,436.858,3.0,91
"The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions, ",437.858,441.858,4.0,91

most of whom make less than two dollars a day. ,448.858,450.858,1.9999999999999432,91
"Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched. ",450.858,453.858,3.0,91
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar. ,454.858,457.858,3.0,91
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar. ,457.858,460.858,3.0,91
"What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches, ",461.858,464.858,3.0,91
"and figure out how to do a drip irrigation, ",464.858,467.858,3.0,91
which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock. ,467.858,471.858,4.0,91
"But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms, ",472.858,475.858,3.0,91
so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre. ,475.858,480.858,5.0,91
A couple of principles: ,480.858,482.858,2.0,91
build small. ,482.858,484.858,2.0,91
Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor. ,484.858,486.858,2.0,91
"This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit ",486.858,491.858,5.0,91
when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to ,491.858,494.858,3.000000000000057,91
with a corrugated iron roof. ,494.858,496.858,2.0,91
"After one harvest, they had increased their income enough ",497.858,501.858,4.0,91
to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre. ,501.858,504.858,3.0,91
"A couple of years later, I meet them. ",504.858,506.858,2.0,91
"They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, ",506.858,509.858,2.999999999999943,91
and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid ,509.858,514.8580000000001,5.0,91
to build their house. ,514.8580000000001,515.8580000000001,1.0,91
"And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes. ",515.8580000000001,518.8580000000001,3.0,91
Something I truly believe. ,518.8580000000001,520.8580000000001,2.0,91
"You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets, ",520.8580000000001,523.8580000000001,3.0,91
and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard ,523.8580000000001,526.8580000000001,3.0,91
huge kudos for bringing to the world ,526.8580000000001,529.8580000000001,3.0,91
this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life. ,529.8580000000001,533.8580000000001,4.0,91
Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year. ,533.8580000000001,537.8580000000001,4.0,91
300 to 500 million cases are reported. ,537.8580000000001,539.8580000000001,2.0,91
It's estimated that Africa loses ,539.8580000000001,541.8580000000001,2.0,91
about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease. ,541.8580000000001,543.8580000000001,2.0,91
Five dollars can save a life. ,543.8580000000001,545.8580000000001,2.0,91
We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars -- ,545.8580000000001,548.8580000000001,3.0,91
why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people? ,548.8580000000001,551.8580000000001,3.0,91
"The question, though, is not ""Why can't we?"" ",552.8580000000001,555.8580000000001,3.0,91
The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves? ,555.8580000000001,559.8580000000001,4.0,91
A lot of hurdles. ,560.8580000000001,561.8580000000001,1.0,91
One: production is too low. Two: price is too high. ,561.8580000000001,564.8580000000001,3.0,91
Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located. ,564.8580000000001,569.8580000000001,5.0,91
"Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible. ",569.8580000000001,572.8580000000001,3.0,91
"We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan ",572.8580000000001,575.8580000000001,3.0,91
to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa ,576.8580000000001,578.8580000000001,2.0,91
so that they could transfer technology from Japan ,578.8580000000001,583.8580000000001,5.0,91
"and build these long-lasting, five-year nets. ",583.8580000000001,585.8580000000001,2.0,91
Here are just some pictures of the factory. ,585.8580000000001,587.8580000000001,2.0,91
"Today, three years later, the company has employed ",587.8580000000001,590.8580000000001,3.0,91
another thousand women. ,590.8580000000001,592.8580000000001,2.0,91
"It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania. ",593.8580000000001,598.8580000000001,5.0,91
It's the largest company in Tanzania. ,598.8580000000001,600.8580000000001,2.0,91
"The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets, ",600.8580000000001,603.8580000000001,3.0,91
three million by the end of the year. ,603.8580000000001,605.8580000000001,2.0,91
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year. ,605.8580000000001,607.8580000000001,2.0,91
So the production side is working. ,608.8580000000001,610.8580000000001,2.0,91
"On the distribution side, though, ",610.8580000000001,611.8580000000001,1.0,91
"as a world, we have a lot of work to do. ",611.8580000000001,613.8580000000001,2.0,91
"Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N., ",613.8580000000001,617.8580000000001,4.0,91
and then given primarily to people around Africa. ,617.8580000000001,621.8580000000001,4.0,91
We're looking at building ,621.8580000000001,623.8580000000001,2.0,91
on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people. ,623.8580000000001,626.8580000000001,3.0,91
Their women. ,626.8580000000001,628.8580000000001,2.0,91
"And so I want you to meet Jacqueline, ",628.8580000000001,630.8580000000001,2.0,91
"my namesake, 21 years old. ",630.8580000000001,632.8580000000001,2.0,91
"If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania, ",632.8580000000001,634.8580000000001,2.0,91
"I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street. ",634.8580000000001,636.8580000000001,2.0,91
"She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money ",636.8580000000001,640.8580000000001,4.0,91
to put a down payment on her house. ,640.8580000000001,642.8580000000001,2.0,91
"She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund, ",642.8580000000001,646.8580000000001,4.0,91
and told me she is not marrying nor having children ,646.8580000000001,649.8580000000001,3.0,91
until these things are completed. ,649.8580000000001,652.8580000000001,3.0,91
"And so, when I told her about our idea -- ",652.8580000000001,654.8580000000001,2.0,91
"that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, ",654.8580000000001,657.8580000000001,3.0,91
and find a way for the women themselves to go out ,657.8580000000001,660.8580000000001,3.0,91
and sell these nets to others -- ,660.8580000000001,662.8580000000001,2.0,91
she quickly started calculating what she herself could make ,662.8580000000001,665.8580000000001,3.0,91
and signed up. ,665.8580000000001,667.8580000000001,2.0,91
"We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies, ",667.8580000000001,672.8580000000001,5.0,91
"and quickly did a prototyping on this, ",672.8580000000001,674.8580000000001,2.0,91
and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives. ,674.8580000000001,677.8580000000001,3.0,91
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts ,677.8580000000001,681.8580000000001,4.0,91
"together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, ",681.8580000000001,683.8580000000001,2.0,91
"despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, ",683.8580000000001,686.8580000000001,3.0,91
and we learned a lot about how you sell things. ,686.8580000000001,689.8580000000001,3.0,91
"Not coming in with our own notions, ",689.8580000000001,691.8580000000001,2.0,91
because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. ,691.8580000000001,693.8580000000001,2.0,91
"First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty. ",693.8580000000001,696.8580000000001,3.0,91
"These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house. ",696.8580000000001,699.8580000000001,3.0,91
Children can sleep through the night; ,699.8580000000001,701.8580000000001,2.0,91
the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window. ,701.8580000000001,703.8580000000001,2.0,91
"And we've started making curtains, ",703.8580000000001,705.8580000000001,2.0,91
"and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- ",705.8580000000001,709.8580000000001,4.0,91
that you care about your children. ,709.8580000000001,710.8580000000001,1.0,91
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives. ,710.8580000000001,714.8580000000001,4.0,91
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell ,715.8580000000001,718.8580000000001,3.0,91
goods and services to the poor. ,718.8580000000001,721.8580000000001,3.0,91
I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity ,722.8580000000001,726.8580000000001,4.0,91
to make poverty history. ,727.8580000000001,729.8580000000001,2.0,91
"To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, ",729.8580000000001,732.8580000000001,3.0,91
"that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, ",732.8580000000001,736.8580000000001,4.0,91
people all over the developing world ,736.8580000000001,738.8580000000001,2.0,91
"who fit in this category, to do it themselves. ",738.8580000000001,741.8580000000001,3.0,91
"Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement. ",741.8580000000001,744.8580000000001,3.0,91
"It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, ",744.8580000000001,747.8580000000001,3.0,91
that they want to make their own decisions; ,747.8580000000001,749.8580000000001,2.0,91
they want to solve their own problems; ,749.8580000000001,751.8580000000001,2.0,91
"and that by engaging with them, ",751.8580000000001,753.8580000000001,2.0,91
"not only do we create much more dignity for them, ",753.8580000000001,756.8580000000001,3.0,91
but for us as well. ,756.8580000000001,758.8580000000001,2.0,91
And so I urge all of you to think next time ,758.8580000000001,761.8580000000001,3.0,91
as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity ,761.8580000000001,765.8580000000001,4.0,91
that we all have -- to make poverty history -- ,765.8580000000001,768.8580000000001,3.0,91
by really becoming part of the process ,768.8580000000001,770.8580000000001,2.0,91
"and moving away from an us-and-them world, ",770.8580000000001,772.8580000000001,2.0,91
"and realizing that it's about all of us, ",772.8580000000001,774.8580000000001,2.0,91
"and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share. ",774.8580000000001,777.8580000000001,3.0,91
Thank you. ,777.8580000000001,778.8580000000001,1.0,91

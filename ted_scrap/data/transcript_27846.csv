00:00:12.677,00:00:14.237,Take a look at this work of art.,
00:00:16.136,00:00:17.655,What is it that you see?,
00:00:19.022,00:00:22.673,"At first glance, it looks",to be a grandfather clock
00:00:22.697,00:00:24.440,with a sheet thrown over it,
00:00:24.464,00:00:26.360,and a rope tied around the center.,
00:00:27.615,00:00:30.663,But a first look always warrants a second.,
00:00:31.549,00:00:32.699,Look again.,
00:00:33.709,00:00:34.859,What do you see now?,
00:00:35.788,00:00:37.701,"If you look more closely,",
00:00:37.725,00:00:41.875,you'll realize,that this entire work of art
00:00:41.899,00:00:44.427,is made from one piece of sculpture.,
00:00:44.803,00:00:46.396,"There is no clock,",
00:00:46.420,00:00:47.960,"there is no rope,",
00:00:47.984,00:00:49.414,and there is no sheet.,
00:00:49.980,00:00:53.763,It is one piece of bleached,Honduras mahogany.
00:00:54.927,00:00:56.617,Now let me be clear:,
00:00:56.641,00:01:01.159,this exercise was not,about looking at sculpture.
00:01:02.467,00:01:03.617,It's about looking,
00:01:04.398,00:01:09.173,and understanding,"that looking closely can save a life,"
00:01:09.197,00:01:10.667,change your company,
00:01:10.691,00:01:14.954,and even help you understand,why your children behave the way they do.
00:01:15.532,00:01:18.366,It's a skill that I call,"visual intelligence,"
00:01:18.390,00:01:20.969,"and I use works of art to teach everybody,",
00:01:20.993,00:01:25.682,from everyday people,"to those for whom looking is the job,"
00:01:25.706,00:01:30.471,like Navy SEALs and homicide,detectives and trauma nurses.
00:01:31.422,00:01:35.228,The fact is that no matter how skilled,"you might be at looking,"
00:01:35.252,00:01:38.566,you still have so much,to learn about seeing.
00:01:38.590,00:01:43.019,Because we all think we get it,"in a first glance and a sudden flash,"
00:01:43.043,00:01:47.534,but the real skill is in understanding,how to look slowly
00:01:47.558,00:01:49.433,and how to look more carefully.,
00:01:49.457,00:01:51.829,The talent is in remembering --,
00:01:51.853,00:01:55.906,in the crush of the daily urgencies,that demand our attention --
00:01:55.930,00:01:59.983,to step back and look through,those lenses to help us see
00:02:00.007,00:02:01.760,what we've been missing all along.,
00:02:02.984,00:02:06.196,So how can looking at painting,and sculpture help?
00:02:06.660,00:02:08.841,Because art is a powerful tool.,
00:02:10.145,00:02:14.729,It's a powerful tool,that engages both sight and insight
00:02:14.753,00:02:19.236,and reframes our understanding,of where we are and what we see.
00:02:20.493,00:02:23.534,Here's an example of a work of art,
00:02:23.558,00:02:26.487,that reminded me,that visual intelligence --
00:02:26.511,00:02:28.461,it's an ongoing learning process,
00:02:28.485,00:02:30.537,and one that really is never mastered.,
00:02:31.079,00:02:34.869,"I came across this quiet,","seemingly abstract painting,"
00:02:34.893,00:02:37.196,"and I had to step up to it twice,",
00:02:37.220,00:02:38.436,"even three times,",
00:02:38.460,00:02:41.522,to understand why it resonated so deeply.,
00:02:42.104,00:02:46.414,"Now, I've seen the Washington Monument","in person thousands of times,"
00:02:46.438,00:02:50.412,well aware of the change in the color,"of marble a third of the way up,"
00:02:50.436,00:02:53.636,but I had never really looked,at it out of context
00:02:53.660,00:02:55.593,or truly as a work of art.,
00:02:56.628,00:03:02.492,"And here, Georgia O'Keeffe's painting",of this architectural icon made me realize
00:03:02.516,00:03:04.706,"that if we put our mind to it,",
00:03:04.730,00:03:07.892,it's possible to see everyday things,
00:03:07.916,00:03:10.859,in a wholly new,and eye-opening perspective.
00:03:11.821,00:03:15.909,"Now, there are some skeptics that believe",that art just belongs in an art museum.
00:03:17.807,00:03:21.573,They believe that it has no practical,use beyond its aesthetic value.
00:03:21.597,00:03:24.138,I know who they are,in every audience I teach.
00:03:24.162,00:03:26.907,"Their arms are crossed,","their legs are crossed,"
00:03:26.931,00:03:28.583,"their body language is saying,",
00:03:28.607,00:03:31.180,"""What am I going to learn",from this lady who talks fast
00:03:31.204,00:03:33.145,"about painting and sculpture?""",
00:03:34.833,00:03:37.299,So how do I make it relevant for them?,
00:03:39.036,00:03:41.267,"I ask them to look at this work of art,",
00:03:41.291,00:03:43.552,like this portrait by Kumi Yamashita.,
00:03:44.346,00:03:46.364,"And I ask them to step in close,",
00:03:46.388,00:03:48.609,"and even closer still,",
00:03:48.633,00:03:50.870,and while they're looking,"at the work of art,"
00:03:50.894,00:03:53.594,they need to be asking questions,about what they see.
00:03:54.299,00:03:56.041,"And if they ask the right questions,",
00:03:56.065,00:03:57.683,"like, ""What is this work of art?",
00:03:57.707,00:03:59.482,Is it a painting? Is it a sculpture?,
00:03:59.506,00:04:00.656,"What is it made of?"" ...",
00:04:00.680,00:04:03.909,they will find out,that this entire work of art
00:04:03.933,00:04:05.677,"is made of a wooden board,",
00:04:05.701,00:04:07.330,"10,000 nails",
00:04:07.354,00:04:09.960,and one unbroken piece of sewing thread.,
00:04:10.621,00:04:12.799,Now that might be,"interesting to some of you,"
00:04:12.823,00:04:15.844,but what does it have to do,with the work that these people do?
00:04:15.868,00:04:17.711,And the answer is everything.,
00:04:17.735,00:04:22.019,Because we all interact with people,"multiple times on a daily basis,"
00:04:22.043,00:04:24.449,and we need to get better,at asking questions
00:04:24.473,00:04:26.285,about what it is that we see.,
00:04:27.378,00:04:29.939,Learning to frame,the question in such a way
00:04:29.963,00:04:33.014,as to elicit the information,"that we need to do our jobs,"
00:04:33.038,00:04:34.813,is a critical life skill.,
00:04:35.622,00:04:37.908,Like the radiologist who told me,
00:04:37.932,00:04:40.432,that looking at the negative,spaces in a painting
00:04:40.456,00:04:44.482,helped her discern,more discreet abnormalities in an MRI.
00:04:45.030,00:04:50.195,Or the police officer who said,that understanding the emotional dynamic
00:04:50.219,00:04:51.777,between people in a painting,
00:04:51.801,00:04:56.090,helped him to read body language,"at a domestic violence crime scene,"
00:04:56.114,00:05:01.513,and it enabled him to think twice,before drawing and firing his weapon.
00:05:01.537,00:05:06.543,And even parents can look to see,absences of color in paintings
00:05:06.567,00:05:10.085,to understand that,what their children say to them
00:05:10.109,00:05:12.409,is as important as what they don't say.,
00:05:13.724,00:05:15.438,So how do I --,
00:05:16.430,00:05:19.518,how do I train to be,more visually intelligent?
00:05:20.342,00:05:22.619,It comes down to four As.,
00:05:22.643,00:05:25.125,"Every new situation, every new problem --",
00:05:25.149,00:05:26.683,we practice four As.,
00:05:26.707,00:05:28.196,"First, we assess our situation.",
00:05:28.220,00:05:30.455,"We ask, ""What do we have in front of us?""",
00:05:30.479,00:05:32.017,"Then, we analyze it.",
00:05:32.041,00:05:33.366,"We say, ""What's important?",
00:05:33.390,00:05:35.122,"What do I need? What don't I need?""",
00:05:35.146,00:05:38.912,"Then, we articulate it in a conversation,","in a memo, in a text, in an email."
00:05:38.936,00:05:41.535,"And then, we act: we make a decision.",
00:05:42.419,00:05:44.777,"We all do this multiple times a day,",
00:05:44.801,00:05:48.445,but we don't realize what a role,seeing and looking plays
00:05:48.469,00:05:50.048,"in all of those actions,",
00:05:50.072,00:05:53.736,and how visual intelligence,can really improve everything.
00:05:54.583,00:05:57.249,"So recently, I had a group",of counterterrorism officials
00:05:57.273,00:05:59.232,at a museum in front of this painting.,
00:05:59.256,00:06:02.686,"El Greco's painting,","""The Purification of the Temple,"""
00:06:02.710,00:06:06.797,"in which Christ, in the center,","in a sweeping and violent gesture,"
00:06:06.821,00:06:09.728,is expelling the sinners,from the temple of prayer.
00:06:10.279,00:06:13.890,The group of counterterrorism officials,"had five minutes with that painting,"
00:06:13.914,00:06:17.826,"and in that short amount of time,","they had to assess the situation,"
00:06:17.850,00:06:19.540,"analyze the details,",
00:06:19.564,00:06:21.256,"articulate what, if anything,",
00:06:21.280,00:06:23.803,they would do if they were,in that painting.
00:06:25.287,00:06:28.687,"As you can imagine,",observations and insights differed.
00:06:28.711,00:06:29.862,Who would they talk to?,
00:06:29.886,00:06:31.392,Who would be the best witness?,
00:06:31.416,00:06:33.002,Who was a good potential witness?,
00:06:33.026,00:06:34.177,Who was lurking?,
00:06:34.201,00:06:35.601,Who had the most information?,
00:06:36.089,00:06:39.561,But my favorite comment,came from a seasoned cop
00:06:39.585,00:06:41.700,"who looked at the central figure and said,",
00:06:41.724,00:06:43.359,"""You see that guy in the pink?"" --",
00:06:43.383,00:06:44.613,referring to Christ --,
00:06:44.637,00:06:47.279,"he said, ""I'd collar him,","he's causing all the trouble."""
00:06:47.303,00:06:50.431,(Laughter),
00:06:50.455,00:06:55.852,So looking at art gives us a perfect,vehicle to rethink how we solve problems
00:06:55.876,00:06:57.518,without the aid of technology.,
00:06:57.542,00:07:00.225,Looking at the work,"of Felix Gonzalez-Torres,"
00:07:00.249,00:07:03.336,you see two clocks,in perfect synchronicity.
00:07:03.907,00:07:07.924,"The hour, minute and",second hand perfectly aligned.
00:07:07.948,00:07:11.250,They are installed side by side,"and they're touching,"
00:07:11.274,00:07:14.352,and they are entitled,"""'Untitled' (Perfect Lovers)."""
00:07:15.389,00:07:17.501,But closer analysis makes you realize,
00:07:17.525,00:07:20.674,that these are two,"battery-operated clocks,"
00:07:20.698,00:07:22.533,which in turn makes you understand --,
00:07:22.557,00:07:23.799,"""Hey, wait a minute ...",
00:07:23.823,00:07:26.526,One of those batteries,is going to stop before the other.
00:07:26.550,00:07:29.706,One of those clocks is going,to slow down and die before the other
00:07:29.730,00:07:32.213,and it's going to alter,"the symmetry of the artwork."""
00:07:33.031,00:07:36.139,Just articulating that thought process,
00:07:36.163,00:07:39.455,includes the necessity,of a contingency plan.
00:07:40.645,00:07:43.325,You need to have contingencies,"for the unforeseen,"
00:07:43.349,00:07:45.825,"the unexpected and the unknown,",
00:07:45.849,00:07:48.502,whenever and however they may happen.,
00:07:50.108,00:07:53.705,"Now, using art to increase",our visual intelligence
00:07:53.729,00:07:55.790,"involves planning for contingencies,",
00:07:55.814,00:07:58.212,understanding the big picture,and the small details
00:07:58.236,00:07:59.871,and noticing what's not there.,
00:08:00.357,00:08:02.811,"So in this painting by Magritte,",
00:08:02.835,00:08:05.985,noticing that there are no tracks,"under the train,"
00:08:06.009,00:08:08.173,there is no fire in the fireplace,
00:08:08.197,00:08:10.375,and there are no candles,in the candlesticks
00:08:10.399,00:08:13.216,actually more accurately,describes the painting
00:08:13.240,00:08:16.755,"than if you were to say, ""Well,","there's a train coming out of a fireplace,"
00:08:16.779,00:08:18.865,"and there are candlesticks on the mantle.""",
00:08:18.889,00:08:21.552,It may sound counterintuitive,"to say what isn't there,"
00:08:21.576,00:08:23.613,but it's really a very valuable tool.,
00:08:24.356,00:08:27.116,When a detective who had learned,about visual intelligence
00:08:27.140,00:08:28.291,in North Carolina,
00:08:28.315,00:08:29.791,"was called to the crime scene,",
00:08:29.815,00:08:31.255,"it was a boating fatality,",
00:08:31.279,00:08:34.839,and the eyewitness told this detective,that the boat had flipped over
00:08:34.863,00:08:37.574,and the occupant had drowned underneath.,
00:08:38.013,00:08:41.663,"Now, instinctively, crime scene","investigators look for what is apparent,"
00:08:41.687,00:08:43.887,but this detective,did something different.
00:08:43.911,00:08:46.498,"He looked for what wasn't there,",which is harder to do.
00:08:47.003,00:08:48.318,And he raised the question:,
00:08:48.342,00:08:51.254,if the boat had really,tipped flipped over --
00:08:51.278,00:08:53.496,as the eyewitness said that it did --,
00:08:53.520,00:08:56.275,how come the papers that were kept,at one end of the boat
00:08:56.299,00:08:57.900,were completely dry?,
00:08:58.858,00:09:02.246,Based on that one small,"but critical observation,"
00:09:02.270,00:09:06.231,the investigation shifted,from accidental death to homicide.
00:09:08.215,00:09:10.855,"Now, equally important",to saying what isn't there
00:09:10.879,00:09:15.498,is the ability to find visual connections,where they may not be apparent.
00:09:16.400,00:09:19.452,Like Marie Watt's totem pole of blankets.,
00:09:19.476,00:09:23.560,It illustrates that finding hidden,connections in everyday objects
00:09:23.584,00:09:25.315,can resonate so deeply.,
00:09:25.754,00:09:28.435,The artist collected blankets,from all different people
00:09:28.459,00:09:29.927,"in her community,",
00:09:29.951,00:09:33.205,and she had the owners,"of the blankets write, on a tag,"
00:09:33.229,00:09:35.773,the significance of,the blanket to the family.
00:09:36.406,00:09:39.071,Some of the blankets,"had been used for baby blankets,"
00:09:39.095,00:09:41.295,some of them had been used,"as picnic blankets,"
00:09:41.319,00:09:43.731,some of them had been used for the dog.,
00:09:44.344,00:09:47.150,We all have blankets in our homes,
00:09:47.174,00:09:49.725,and understand the significance,that they play.
00:09:50.662,00:09:53.003,"But similarly, I instruct new doctors:",
00:09:53.027,00:09:54.923,"when they walk into a patient's room,",
00:09:54.947,00:09:58.139,"before they pick up that medical chart,",
00:09:58.163,00:09:59.965,just look around the room.,
00:09:59.989,00:10:02.284,"Are there balloons or cards,",
00:10:02.308,00:10:04.520,or that special blanket on the bed?,
00:10:05.429,00:10:09.129,That tells the doctor there's a connection,to the outside world.
00:10:09.153,00:10:12.850,If that patient has someone,in the outside world
00:10:12.874,00:10:14.787,"to assist them and help them,",
00:10:14.811,00:10:19.175,the doctor can implement the best care,with that connection in mind.
00:10:20.033,00:10:23.219,"In medicine, people",are connected as humans
00:10:23.243,00:10:26.475,before they're identified,as doctor and patient.
00:10:27.657,00:10:30.212,But this method of enhancing perception --,
00:10:30.236,00:10:31.714,"it need not be disruptive,",
00:10:31.738,00:10:34.538,and it doesn't necessitate,an overhaul in looking.
00:10:35.131,00:10:39.100,Like Jorge MÃ©ndez Blake's sculpture,of building a brick wall
00:10:39.124,00:10:41.958,"above Kafka's book ""El Castillo""",
00:10:41.982,00:10:46.817,shows that more astute observation,can be subtle and yet invaluable.
00:10:47.793,00:10:49.571,"You can discern the book,",
00:10:49.595,00:10:51.921,and you can see,how it disrupted the symmetry
00:10:51.945,00:10:54.296,"of the bricks directly above it,",
00:10:54.320,00:10:56.796,but by the time you get,"to the end of the sculpture,"
00:10:56.820,00:10:58.628,you can no longer see the book.,
00:10:59.066,00:11:02.186,But looking at the work of art,"in its entirety,"
00:11:02.210,00:11:06.490,you see that the impact,of the work's disruption on the bricks
00:11:06.514,00:11:08.822,is nuanced and unmistakable.,
00:11:09.487,00:11:10.884,"One thought,",
00:11:10.908,00:11:12.570,"one idea,",
00:11:12.594,00:11:16.256,"one innovation can alter an approach,",
00:11:16.280,00:11:17.810,change a process,
00:11:17.834,00:11:19.728,and even save lives.,
00:11:20.557,00:11:24.310,I've been teaching visual intelligence,"for over 15 years,"
00:11:24.334,00:11:27.550,and to my great amazement,and astonishment --
00:11:27.574,00:11:30.350,to my never-ending astonishment,"and amazement,"
00:11:30.374,00:11:33.902,I have seen that looking at art,with a critical eye
00:11:33.926,00:11:37.338,can help to anchor us in our world,"of uncharted waters,"
00:11:37.362,00:11:39.601,"whether you are a paramilitary trooper,",
00:11:39.625,00:11:42.574,"a caregiver, a doctor or a mother.",
00:11:43.114,00:11:45.688,"Because let's face it, things go wrong.",
00:11:46.636,00:11:47.637,(Laughter),
00:11:47.661,00:11:48.871,Things go wrong.,
00:11:48.895,00:11:50.242,"And don't misunderstand me,",
00:11:50.266,00:11:51.913,I'd eat that doughnut in a minute.,
00:11:51.937,00:11:52.995,(Laughter),
00:11:53.019,00:11:57.664,But we need to understand the consequences,"of what it is that we observe,"
00:11:57.688,00:12:02.059,and we need to convert observable details,into actionable knowledge.
00:12:02.876,00:12:06.871,Like Jennifer Odem's sculpture,of tables standing sentinel
00:12:06.895,00:12:08.947,on the banks of the Mississippi River,
00:12:08.971,00:12:10.389,"in New Orleans,",
00:12:10.413,00:12:13.628,guarding against the threat,of post-Katrina floodwaters
00:12:13.652,00:12:16.437,"and rising up against adversity,",
00:12:16.461,00:12:19.310,we too have the ability,to act affirmatively
00:12:19.334,00:12:21.121,and affect positive change.,
00:12:21.881,00:12:24.179,I have been mining the world of art,
00:12:24.203,00:12:27.256,to help people across,the professional spectrum
00:12:27.280,00:12:29.964,"to see the extraordinary in the everyday,",
00:12:29.988,00:12:32.399,to articulate what is absent,
00:12:33.685,00:12:37.078,and to be able to inspire,"creativity and innovation,"
00:12:37.102,00:12:38.563,no matter how small.,
00:12:38.587,00:12:40.146,"And most importantly,",
00:12:40.170,00:12:43.970,to forge human connections,"where they may not be apparent,"
00:12:43.994,00:12:48.867,empowering us all to see our work,and the world writ large
00:12:48.891,00:12:50.379,with a new set of eyes.,
00:12:50.837,00:12:51.988,Thank you.,
